<p>T<span class="smcap">his</span> narrative was originally written without the least
idea of publication, but to gratify the oft-repeated requests
of my children. During the work, the ubiquitous newspaper
reporter learned of it, and persuaded me to permit
its publication in a local paper, where it appeared
in weekly instalments. Since then the demand that I
should put it in more permanent form has been so persistent
and wide-spread, that I have been constrained to
comply, and have carefully revised and in part rewritten
it. I have endeavored to confine myself to my own observations,
experiences, and impressions, giving the inner life
of the soldier as we experienced it. It was my good fortune
to be associated with one of the best bodies of men
who took part in the great Civil War; to share in their
hardships and their achievements. For this I am profoundly
grateful. Their story is my own. If these splendid
gray-headed "boys"&mdash;those who have not yet passed
the mortal firing-line&mdash;shall find some pleasure in again
tramping over that glorious route, and recalling the historic
scenes, and if the younger generation shall gather
inspiration for a like patriotic dedication to country
and to liberty, I shall be more than paid for my imperfect
work. In conclusion, I desire to acknowledge
my indebtedness to Major James W. Oakford, son of
our intrepid colonel, who was the first of the regiment
to fall, and to Mr. Lewis B. Stillwell, son of that brave
and splendid officer, Captain Richard Stillwell, Company
K, who was wounded and disabled at Fredericksburg,
for constant encouragement in the preparation of the
work and for assistance in its publication.</p>

<p class="sml">After the lapse of more than forty years, I hardly hoped to be able to publish
pictures of all our officers, and have been more than pleased to secure so many.
The others, I regret to say, could not be obtained. The youthful appearance of these
officers will be remarked. All, I believe, with the exception of Colonel Oakford
were below thirty years, and most between twenty and twenty-five.</p>

<p class="c smcap">FIRST LESSONS; OR, DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE</p>


<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> appointed adjutant of the One Hundred and
Thirty-second Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, by our
great war Governor, Andrew G. Curtin, at the solicitation
of Colonel Richard A. Oakford, commanding the regiment,
my commission dating the 22d day of August, 1862.
I reported for duty to Colonel Oakford at Camp Whipple,
where the regiment was then encamped, on the 3d day of
September, 1862. This was immediately following the
disasters of "Chantilly" and "Second Bull Run," and as
I passed through Washington to Camp Whipple, I found
the greatest excitement prevailing because of these reverses,
and a general apprehension for the safety of the
capital in consequence. The wildest rumors were abroad
concerning the approach of the victorious rebel troops, and
an alarm amounting almost to a panic existed. Being
without a horse or other means of transportation, I was
obliged to make my way, valise in hand, on foot from
Washington over the "long bridge" across the Potomac,
to Camp Whipple, some two miles up the river nearly
opposite Georgetown. From the wild rumors floating
about Washington, I did not know but I should be captured
bag and baggage before reaching camp. Undertaking
this trip under those circumstances, I think, required
almost as much nerve as "real work" did later on.</p>

<p>Getting beyond the long bridge there were abundant evidences
of the reported disasters. Straggling troops, army
wagons, etc., were pouring in from the "front" in great
disorder. I reached camp about three o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and
found Colonel Oakford out with the regiment on battalion
drill. An hour later I reported to his office (tent) as
ready for duty. The colonel had been a lifelong personal
friend, and I was received, as I expected, most cordially.
I was assigned quarters, and a copy of the daily routine
orders of camp was placed in my hands, and my attention
specially called to the fact that the next "order of business"
was "dress parade" at six o'clock. I inquired the
cause of this special notice to me, and was informed that
I was expected to officiate as adjutant of the regiment
at that ceremony. I pleaded with the colonel to be
allowed a day or so in camp to see how things were
done before undertaking such difficult and important
duties; that I knew absolutely nothing about any part
of military service; had never served a day in any kind
of military work, except in a country fire company; had
never seen a dress parade of a full regiment in my life,
and knew nothing whatever about the duties of an
adjutant.</p>

<p>My pleadings were all in vain. The only reply I received
was a copy of the "Army Regulations," with the
remark that I had two hours in which to study up and
master the details of dress parade, and that I could not
learn my duties any easier nor better than by actual practice;
that my condition was no different from that of my
fellow officers; that we were all there in a camp of instruction
learning our duties, and there was not a moment to
lose. I then began to realize something of the magnitude
of the task which lay before me. To do difficult things,
without knowing how; that is, to learn how in the doing,
was the universal task of the Union volunteer officer. I
took up my "Army Regulations" and attacked the ceremony
of dress parade as a life and death matter. Before
my two hours were ended, I could repeat every sentence of
the ceremony verbatim, and felt that I had mastered the
thing, and was not going to my execution in undertaking
my duties as adjutant. Alas for the frailty of memory;
it failed me at the crucial moment, and I made a miserable
spectacle of myself before a thousand officers and men,
many of them old friends and acquaintances, all of whom,
it seemed to me, were specially assembled on that occasion
to witness my début, and see me get "balled up." They
were not disappointed. Things tactically impossible were
freely done during that ceremony. Looking back now
upon that scene, from the long distance of forty years, I
see a green country boy undertaking to handle one thousand
men in the always difficult ceremony of a dress
parade. (I once heard Governor Hartranft, who attained
the rank of a major-general during the war, remark, as he
witnessed this ceremony, that he had seen thousands of
such parades, and among them all, only one that he considered
absolutely faultless.) I wonder now that we got
through it at all. Think of standing to give your first
command at the right of a line of men five hundred
abreast, that is, nearly one thousand feet in length, and
trying to make the men farthest away hear your small,
unused, and untrained voice. I now can fully forgive
my failure. The officers and men were considerate of
me, however, and, knowing what was to be done, went
through with it after a fashion in spite of my blunders.</p>

<p>The regiment was one of the "nine months'" quota;
it had been in the service barely two weeks at this time. It
was made up of two companies, I and K, from Scranton
(Captains James Archbald, Company I, and Richard Stillwell,
Company K), Company A, Danville, Pa.; B,
Factoryville; C, Wellsboro and vicinity; E, Bloomsburg;
F and G, Mauch Chunk, and H, Catawissa. It numbered,
officers and men, about one thousand. Its field officers
were Colonel Richard A. Oakford, Scranton; Lieutenant-Colonel
Vincent M. Wilcox, Scranton; Major
Charles Albright, Mauch Chunk; staff, Frederick L.
Hitchcock, first lieutenant and adjutant, Scranton; Clinton
W. Neal, first lieutenant and quartermaster, Bloomsburg;
Rev. Schoonmaker, first lieutenant and chaplain,
Scranton.</p>

<p>The transition from home life to that of an army in the
field can only be appreciated from a stand-point of actual
experience. From a well-ordered, well-cooked meal,
served at a comfortable table with the accessories of home,
howsoever humble, to a "catch as catch can" way of
getting "grub," eating what, and when and where, you
are fortunate enough to get to eat; and from a good,
comfortable bed, comfortably housed in a comfortable
home, to a blanket "shake down" under the beautiful
sky, mark some of the features of this transition.</p>

<p>Another feature is the utter change in one's individual
liberty. To be no longer the arbiter of your own time and
movements, but to have it rubbed into you at every turn
that you are a very small part of an immense machine,
whose business is to march and fight; that your every
movement is under the control of your superior officers;
that, in fact, you have no will of your own that can be
exercised; that your individuality is for the time sunk,
is a trial to an American freeman which patriotism alone
can overcome. Not the least feature of this transition is
the practical obliteration of the Lord's day. This is a
great shock to a Christian who has learned to love the
Lord's day and its hallowed associations. Routine duty,
the march, the fighting, all go right on, nothing stops for
Sunday.</p>

<p>On the morning after reaching camp I had the pleasure
of seeing Major-General John Pope, who commanded the
Union forces in the recent battles of Chantilly and Second
Bull Run, and his staff, riding past camp into Washington.
He hailed us with a cheery "Good-morning" in
reply to our salute. He did not look like a badly defeated
general, though he undoubtedly was&mdash;so badly, indeed,
that he was never given any command of importance
afterwards.</p>

<p>On Saturday, September 6, we received orders to join
the Army of the Potomac&mdash;again under the command of
"Little Mac"&mdash;at Rockville, Md., distant about eighteen
miles. This was our first march. The day was excessively
hot, and Colonel Oakford received permission to
march in the evening. We broke camp about six o'clock
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> It was a lovely moonlight night, the road was excellent,
and for the first six miles the march was a delight.
We marched quite leisurely, not making over two miles an
hour, including rests, nevertheless the last half of the distance
was very tiresome, owing to the raw and unseasoned
condition of our men, and the heavy load they were carrying.
We reached the bivouac of the grand Army of the
Potomac, of which we were henceforth to be a part, at
about three o'clock the next morning. Three miles out
from the main camp we encountered the outpost of the
picket line and were duly halted. The picket officer had
been informed of our coming, and so detained us only long
enough to satisfy himself that we were all right.</p>

<p>Here we encountered actual conditions of war with all
its paraphernalia for the first time. Up to this time we
had been playing at war, so to speak, in a camp of instruction.
Now we were entering upon the thing itself, with
all its gruesome accessories. Everything here was business,
and awful business, too. Here were parks of artillery
quiet enough just now, but their throats will speak
soon enough, and when they do it will not be the harmless
booming of Fourth of July celebrations. Here we pass
a bivouac of cavalry, and yonder on either side the road,
in long lines of masses, spread out like wide swaths of
grain, lie the infantry behind long rows of stacked guns.
Here were upward of seventy-five thousand men, all,
except the cordon of pickets, sound asleep. In the midst
of this mighty host the stillness was that of a graveyard;
it seemed almost oppressive.</p>

<p>Halting the regiment, Colonel Oakford and I made our
way to the head-quarters of Major-General Sumner, commanding
the Second Army Corps, to whom the colonel
was ordered to report. We finally found him asleep in his
head-quarters wagon. A tap on the canvas top of the
wagon quickly brought the response, "Hello! Who's
there? What's wanted?"</p>

<p>Colonel Oakford replied, giving his name and rank, and
that his regiment was here to report to him, according to
orders.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, colonel, that is right," replied the general.
"How many men have you?"</p>

<p>Receiving the colonel's answer, General Sumner said:</p>

<p>"I wish you had ten times as many, for we need you
badly. Glad you are here, colonel. Make yourselves as
comfortable as you can for the rest of the night, and I will
assign you to your brigade in the morning."</p>

<p>Here was a cordial reception and hospitality galore.
"Make yourselves comfortable"&mdash;in Hotel "Dame Nature!"
Well, we were all weary enough to accept the hospitality.
We turned into the adjacent field, "stacked
arms," and in a jiffy were rolled up in our blankets and
sound asleep. The mattresses supplied by Madame Nature
were rather hard, but her rooms were fresh and airy, and
the ceilings studded with the stars of glory. My last
waking vision that night was a knowing wink from
Jupiter and Mars, as much as to say, "sleep sweetly, we
are here."</p>

<p>The morning sun was well up before we got ourselves
together the next morning. The "reveille" had no terrors
for us greenhorns then. We found ourselves in the midst
of a division of the bronzed old Army of the Potomac
veterans. They were swarming all over us, and how unmercifully
they did guy us! A regiment of tenderfeet was
just taffy for those fellows. Did our "Ma's know we
were out?" "Get off those purty duds." "Oh, you blue
cherub!" etc., etc., at the same time accepting (?) without
a murmur all the tobacco and other camp rarities they
could reach.</p>

<p>We were soon visited by Brigadier-General Nathan
Kimball, a swarthy, grizzly-bearded old gentleman, with
lots of fire and energy in his eyes. He told the colonel our
regiment had been assigned to his brigade. He directed
the colonel to get the regiment in line, as he had something
to say to the men, after which he would direct us where to
join his troops. General Kimball commanded a brigade
which had achieved a great reputation under McClellan in
his West Virginia campaign, and it had been named by
him the "Gibraltar brigade." It had also been through
the Peninsular and Second Bull Run campaigns. It had
comprised the Fourth and Eighth Ohio, Fourteenth Indiana
and Seventh West Virginia regiments, all of which
had been reduced by hard service to mere skeleton regiments.
The Fourth Ohio had become so small as to require
its withdrawal from the army for recuperation, and
our regiment was to take its place.</p>

<p>To step into the shoes of one of these old regiments was
business, indeed, for us. Could we do it and keep up our
end? It was certainly asking a great deal of a two weeks'
old regiment. But it was the making of us. We were
now a part of the old Gibraltar brigade. Our full address
now was "One Hundred and Thirty-second Pennsylvania
Volunteers, First Brigade, Third Division, Second Army
Corps, Army of the Potomac." Our own reputation we
were now to make. We were on probation in the brigade,
so to speak. These veterans were proud, and justly so, of
their reputation. What our relation to that reputation was
to be, we could see was a mooted question with them.
They guyed us without measure until the crucial test, the
"baptism of fire," had been passed. This occurred just
ten days later, at the battle of Antietam, the greatest battle
of the war thus far, where for four bloody hours we held
our section of the brigade line as stanch as a rock. Here
we earned our footing. Henceforth we belonged to them.
There was never another syllable of guying, but in its place
the fullest meed of such praise and comradeship as is born
only of brave and chivalrous men.</p>

<p>W<span class="smcap">e</span> remained a day in bivouac after joining the Gibraltar
brigade at Rockville, during which rations of fresh
beef, salt pork, and "hardtack" (the boys' nickname for
hard bread) were issued to the army, also ammunition.</p>

<p>The method of issuing rations was as follows: Colonels
of regiments were directed to send in requisitions for so
many days' rations, depending on the movements on hand,
of hard bread and pork, and usually one day's rations of
fresh beef. At brigade head-quarters these requisitions
were consolidated, making the brigade requisition, and
forwarded to division head-quarters. Here they were
again consolidated into a division requisition, and so on
until the army head-quarters was reached. Then the corps
commissary received in bulk enough for his corps, and
distributed it to the divisions in bulk, thence to brigades in
bulk, thence to regiments, and finally from the regiment to
the companies, and to the men. A long string of red tape,
surely; and it might have been considerably shortened to
the advantage of all, as it was later on.</p>

</table>
<p>An interesting feature of the issue of rations was the
method of supplying the fresh beef. Live cattle were
driven to the army and issued alive to the several corps,
from which details were made of men who had been butchers,
who killed and dressed the beef. The animals were
driven into an enclosure and expert marksmen shot them
down as wanted. This seemed cruel work, but it was well
done; the animal being hit usually at the base of its horns,
death was instantaneous. This fresh meat, which we got
but seldom after the march began, was cooked and eaten
the day it was issued. Enough for one day was all that
was issued at a time, and this, after the non-eatable portions
had been eliminated, did not overburden the men.</p>

<p>The hard bread was a square cracker about the size of
an ordinary soda cracker, only thicker, and very hard and
dry. It was supposed to be of the same quality as sea biscuit
or pilot bread, but I never saw any equal to that
article. The salt pork was usually good for pork, but
it was a great trial to us all to come down to camp
fare, "hardtack and pork." Sometimes the "hardtack"
was very old and poor. I have seen many a one
placed in the palm of the hand, a smart blow, a puff of
breath, and mirabile! a handful of "squirmers"&mdash;the
boys' illustration of a "full hand." It came to be the rule
to eat in daylight for protection against the unknown
quantity in the hardtack. If we had to eat in the dark,
after a prolonged march, our protection then lay in breaking
our cracker into a cup of boiling coffee, stir it well and
then flow enough of the coffee over to carry off most of
the strangers and take the balance on faith.</p>

<p>On the march each man carried his own rations in
haversacks. These were made of canvas and contained
pockets for salt, sugar and coffee, besides room for about
two days' rations of hard bread and pork. Sometimes five,
six, and seven days' rations were issued, then the balance
had to be stowed away in knapsacks and pockets of the
clothing. When, as was usual in the latter cases, there
was also issued sixty to one hundred rounds of ammunition,
the man became a veritable pack-mule.</p>

<p>For the first month many of our men went hungry.
Having enormous appetites consequent upon this new and
most strenuous mode of life, they would eat their five days'
supply in two or three, and then have to "skirmish" or go
hungry until the next supply was issued. Most, however,
soon learned the necessity as well as the benefit of restricting
their appetites to the supply. But there were always
some improvident ones, who never had a supply ahead, but
were always in straights for grub. They were ready to
black boots, clean guns, in fact, do any sort of menial work
for their comrades for a snack to eat. Their improvidence
made them the drudges of the company.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said about other portions of the rations,
the coffee was always good. I never saw any poor coffee,
and it was a blessing it was so, for it became the soldiers'
solace and stay, in camp, on picket and on the march.
Tired, footsore, and dusty from the march, or wet and cold
on picket, or homesick and shivering in camp, there were
rest and comfort and new life in a cup of hot coffee. We
could not always have it on picket nor on the march. To
make a cup of coffee two things were necessary besides the
coffee, namely, water and fire, both frequently very difficult
to obtain. On picket water was generally plentiful,
but in the immediate presence of the enemy, fire was forbidden,
for obvious reasons. On the march both were
usually scarce, as I shall show later on. How was our
coffee made? Each man was provided with a pint tin cup.
As much coffee as could comfortably be lifted from the
haversack by the thumb and two fingers&mdash;depending somewhat
on the supply&mdash;was placed in the cup, which was
filled about three-fourths full of water, to leave room for
boiling. It was then placed upon some live coals and
brought to a boil, being well stirred in the meantime to get
the strength of the coffee. A little cold water was then
added to settle it. Eggs, gelatin, or other notions of civilization,
for settling, were studiously (?) omitted. Sometimes
sugar was added, but most of the men, especially the
old vets, took it straight. It was astonishing how many of
the "wrinkles of grim visaged war" were temporarily
smoothed out by a cup of coffee. This was the mainstay
of our meals on the march, a cup of coffee and a thin slice
of raw pork between two hardtacks frequently constituting
a meal. Extras fell in the way once in a while. Chickens
have been known to stray into camp, the result of a night's
foraging.</p>

<p>Among the early experiences of our boys was an incident
related to me by the "boy" who was "it." He said
he had a mighty narrow escape last night.</p>

<p>I asked, "How was that?"</p>

<p>"Out hunting for chickens, struck a farmhouse, got a
nice string, and was sneaking my way out. Dark as tar.
Ran up against man, who grabbed me by the collar, and
demanded 'what are you doing here?' I was mum as an
owl. He marched me out where there was a flickering
light, and sure as blazes it was old General Kimball. I
didn't know that house was brigade head-quarters.</p>

<p>"'What regiment do you belong to?'</p>

<p>"'Dunno.'</p>

<p>"'You've heard about the orders against marauding,
eh?'</p>

<p>"'Dunno.'</p>

<p>"'Hand up those chickens, you rascal.'</p>

<p>"I handed them out from behind my shaking legs.</p>

<p>"'How many have you got?'</p>

<p>"'Dunno'&mdash;I had two pair of nice ones. The old man
took out his knife and slowly cut out one pair, looking
savagely at me all the time.</p>

<p>"'There! You get back to camp as quick as your legs
will carry you, and if I ever get my hands on you again
you'll remember it.'" He said he thought he'd try and
forage away from head-quarters next time. General Kimball
was a rigid disciplinarian, but withal a very kind-hearted
man. He no doubt paid for those chickens rather
than have one of his boys suffer for his foraging escapade.
Perhaps I ought to say a word about these foraging expeditions
to eke out the boys' larder. These men were not
thieves in any sense and very few attempted this dubious
method, but the temptation was almost beyond the power
of resistance. The best way to test this temptation is to
diet yourself on "hardtack" and pork for just about one
week. Then the devil's argument&mdash;always present&mdash;was
practically true there, "the chickens will be taken (not
stolen) by some of the army, and you might as well have
one as anybody."</p>

<p>The following story of a neighboring regiment will
show that even officers high in rank sometimes found
that "circumstances alter cases." The troops were nearing
bivouac at the close of the day, and, as usual, the
colonel ordered the music to start up and the men to
fall into step and approach camp in order (the march is
usually in route step,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, every man marches and carries
his gun as he pleases). The fifes and the snare-drums
promptly obeyed, but the big bass drum was silent. The
men fell into cadence step in fine shape, including the
bass drummer, but his big shell gave forth no sound.
The colonel called out, "What's the matter with the bass
drum?" Still no response. A second ejaculation from
head-quarters, a little more emphatic, fared no better.
Patience now exhausted, the colonel yelled, "What in
h&mdash;l's the matter, I say, with&mdash;&mdash;" when a sotto voice
reached his ear, with "Colonel, colonel, he's got a pair
of chickens in his drum, and one is for you." "Well,
if the poor fellow is sick, let him fall out."</p>

<p>A little explanation now about how the army is organized
will probably make my story clearer. That an army
is made of three principal arms, viz., artillery, cavalry, and
infantry, is familiar to all; that the cavalry is mounted is
also well known, but that in actual fighting they were often
dismounted and fought as infantry may not be familiar to
all. The cavalry and infantry&mdash;or foot troops&mdash;are organized
practically alike, viz., first into companies of 101
men and officers; second, into regiments of ten companies,
or less, of infantry and twelve companies, more
or less, of cavalry, two or more companies of cavalry
constituting a "squadron," and a like number of companies
of infantry a "battalion;" third, into brigades
of two or more&mdash;usually four&mdash;regiments; fourth, divisions
of two or more&mdash;usually three&mdash;brigades; fifth,
army corps, any number of divisions&mdash;usually not more
than three. Logically, the rank of officers commanding
these several subdivisions would be colonel, commanding
a regiment; brigadier-general, his rank being indicated
by one star, a brigade; a major-general, two stars, a division;
a lieutenant-general, three stars, an army corps;
and the whole army a general, his rank being indicated by
four stars. This was carried out by the Confederates in
the organization of their armies. But not so with ours.
With few exceptions&mdash;ours being one&mdash;the brigades were
commanded by the senior colonels, and towards the end of
the war this was sometimes temporarily true of divisions;
the divisions by brigadiers, whilst we had no higher rank
than that of major-general until General Grant was made,
first, lieutenant-general, and finally general.</p>

<p>The artillery was organized into companies commonly
called batteries. There were two branches, heavy and
light artillery. The former were organized more like infantry,
marched on foot and were armed with muskets in
addition to the heavy guns they were trained to use. The
latter were used against fortifications and were rarely
brought into field work. The light artillery were mounted
either on the horses or on the gun-carriages, and, though
organized into a separate corps under the direction of the
chief of artillery, were usually distributed among the divisions,
one or two batteries accompanying each division.</p>

<p>In addition to these chief branches of the service, there
was the signal corps, the "eyes" of the army, made up
mostly of young lieutenants and non-commissioned officers
detailed from the several regiments. There were two such
officers from Scranton, namely, Lieutenant Fred. J. Amsden,
One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers,
and Lieutenant Frederick Fuller, Fifty-second
Pennsylvania Volunteers, besides a number of enlisted
men.</p>

<p>Another important branch of the service was the telegraph
corps. It was remarkable the celerity with which
wires would be run along the ground and on brush, day
by day, keeping the several corps constantly in touch with
the commanding general. There were comparatively few
telegraph operators that could be detailed, and many had
to be hired,&mdash;some boys who were too young to enlist.
Dr. J. Emmet O'Brien, of this city, was one of the most
efficient of the latter class.</p>

<p>It was Dr. O'Brien, then operating below Petersburg,
who caught the telegraphic cipher of the rebels and by
tapping their wires caught many messages which were of
material assistance to General Grant in the closing movements
of the war. It was he also who in like manner
caught the movements of Jeff Davis and his cabinet in
their efforts to escape, and put General Wilson on his
track, resulting in his final capture. Mr. Richard O'Brien,
the doctor's older brother, for many years superintendent
of the Western Union Telegraph lines in this end of the
State, was at that time Government Superintendent of
Telegraphs, in charge of all its telegraphic operations in
Virginia and North Carolina. He could tell many a hair-raising
experience. He related to me the following incident,
which occurred during Grant's operations around
Petersburg, to illustrate the enterprise of the enemy in
trying to get our telegrams, and the necessity of sending
all messages in cipher. They never succeeded in translating
the Union cipher. But one day an operator at
Washington, either too lazy or too careless to put his
message in cipher, telegraphed to the chief commissary at
a place below City Point that fifteen hundred head of beef
cattle would be landed at that point on a certain day. The
message was caught by the rebels. The beef cattle were
landed on time, but in the meantime Wade Hampton had
swept in with a division of rebel cavalry and was waiting
to receive the cattle. With them were captured a handsome
lot of rations and a number of prisoners, including
all of Mr. O'Brien's telegraph operators at that post. Mr.
O'Brien said he cared a good deal more about the loss of
his operators than he did for the loss of the cattle and
rations, for it was very hard to get competent operators at
that time. There was at least one vacancy at Washington
following this incident.</p>

<p>Still another arm of the service was the pontoniers,
whose duty it was to bridge non-fordable rivers. They
were armed and drilled as infantry, but only for their own
protection. Their specialty was laying and removing pontoon
bridges. A pontoon train consisted of forty to fifty
wagons, each carrying pontoon boats, with plank and
stringers for flooring and oars and anchors for placing.
In laying a bridge these boats were anchored side by side
across the stream, stringers made fast across them, and
plank then placed on the stringers. Every piece was
securely keyed into place so that the bridge was wide
enough and strong enough for a battery of artillery and a
column of infantry to go over at the same time. The
rapidity with which they would either lay or take up a
bridge was amazing. If undisturbed they would bridge a
stream two hundred yards wide in thirty minutes. They
bridged the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg under fire
on the 12th of December, 1863, in a little over an hour,
losing heavily in the act.</p>

<p>Having now given some account of the organization of
this great human fighting machine, it will be proper to
show how it was handled. For this purpose there were
four staff departments, namely, the adjutant-general's, the
quartermaster-general's, the commissary-general's, and the
ordnance departments. The first named was the mouth-piece
of the army. All orders were issued by and through
that officer. It was the book-keeper of the army. Each
subdivision of the army had its adjutant-general down to
the office of adjutant in the regiment, who was charged
with issuing all orders, and with attending to their execution.
He was secretary, so to speak, of the commanding
officer, and his chief executive officer as well. Extraordinary
executive talent and tireless energy were required
in these positions. The adjutant must be able at all times
to inform his chief of the condition of every detail of the
command whether an army corps or regiment, exactly how
many men were fit for duty, how many sick or disabled,
and just where they all are. In fact, he must be a walking
encyclopædia of the whole command; added to this he was
usually chief of staff, and must be in the saddle superintending
every movement of the troops. Always first on
duty, his work was never finished.</p>

<p>Two of the best adjutants-general the world has produced
literally wore themselves out in the service&mdash;Seth
Williams and John B. Rawlins. The first named was
McClellan's adjutant-general, the latter was Grant's. McClellan
is credited with having organized the grand old
Army of the Potomac, the main fighting force by which
the rebellion was finally crushed. This was doubtless true,
he being its first commanding officer. But the executive
ability by which that magnificent machine was perfected
was largely the work of Seth Williams, a very quiet,
modest man, but a master of the minutest details of every
department and an indefatigable worker. It was said his
chief could wake him in the middle of the night and get
from his memory a correct answer as to the number of men
fit for duty in any one of the hundreds of regiments in the
army, and just where it was, and what duty it was doing.
When one remembers that this knowledge was acquired
only by a daily perusal of the consolidated reports of the
various regiments, brigades, divisions, and corps of the
army, and that he could have found time for one reading
only, it will be seen how marvellous his memory was.</p>

<p>Rawlins was said to possess much the same quality. It
may truthfully be said that the Army of the Potomac was
organized and began its remarkable career in the life blood
of Seth Williams, and it completed its work in a blaze of
glory, in the life blood of John B. Rawlins. Seth Williams
died in the service. Rawlins came home with the
victorious army only to die. A beautiful bronze equestrian
statue was erected at Washington under the influence of
his beloved chief, Grant, to commemorate the services of
Rawlins. So far as I know, Seth Williams shares the fate
of most of his humbler comrades,&mdash;an unmarked grave.</p>

<p>I have said all orders were sent out through the adjutant-general's
office. This, of course, applies to all regular
routine work only, for during the movements of troops
on campaigns and in battle orders had in the nature of
the case to be delivered verbally. For this purpose each
general had a number of aides-de-camp. In sending such
orders, the utmost courtesy was always observed. The
formula was usually thus, "General Kimball presents his
compliments to Colonel Oakford and directs that he move
his regiment to such and such a point." To which Colonel
Oakford responds returning his compliments to General
Kimball and says "his order directing so and so has been
received and shall be immediately obeyed."</p>

<p>The quartermaster's department was charged with all
matters connected with transportation; with the supplying
of clothing, canvas, and equipage of all sorts. Both
the commissary and the ordnance departments were dependent
upon the quartermaster for the transportation of
their respective stores. The wagon trains required by the
Army of the Potomac for all this service were prodigious.
They were made up of four and six mule teams with heavy
"prairie schooners" or canvas-covered wagons. I have
seen two thousand of them halted for the night in a single
park, and such trains on the march six to ten miles long
were not unusual. It will readily be seen that to have
them within easy reach, and prevent their falling into
the hands of an alert enemy, was a tremendous problem
in all movements of the army.</p>

<p>The army mule has been much caricatured, satirized,
and abused, but the soldier had no more faithful or indispensable
servant than this same patient, plodding, hard-pulling,
long-eared fellow of the roomy voice and nimble
heels. The "boys" told a story which may illustrate the
mule's education. A "tenderfoot" driver had gotten his
team stalled in a mud hole, and by no amount of persuasion
could he get them to budge an inch. Helpers at
the wheels and new hands on the lines were all to no purpose.
A typical army bummer had been eying the scene
with contemptuous silence. Finally he cut loose:</p>

<p>"Say! You 'uns dunno the mule language. Ye dunno
the dilec. Let a perfesser in there."</p>

<p>He was promptly given the job. He doffed cap and
blouse, marched up to those mules as if he weighed a ton
and commanded the army. Clearing away the crowd, he
seized the leader's line, and distending his lungs, he shot
out in a voice that could have been heard a mile a series of
whoops, oaths, adjectives, and billingsgate that would
have silenced the proverbial London fish vender. The
mules recognized the "dilec" at once, pricked up their
ears and took the load out in a jiffy.</p>

<p>"Ye see, gents, them ar mules is used to workin' with a
perfesser."</p>

<p>The commissary department supplied the rations, and
the ordnance department the arms and ammunition, etc.
Still another branch of the service was the provost-marshal's
department. This was the police force of the army.
It had the care and custody of all prisoners, whether those
arrested for crime, or prisoners of war&mdash;those captured
from the enemy. In the case of prisoners sentenced to
death by court-martial, the provost guard were their
executioners.</p>

<p>W<span class="smcap">e</span> are bound northward through Maryland, the vets
tell us, on a chase after the rebs. The army marches in
three and four parallel columns, usually each corps in a
column by itself, and distant from the other columns equal
to about its length in line of battle, say a half to three-fourths
of a mile. Roads were utilized as far as practicable,
but generally were left to the artillery and the
wagon trains, whilst the infantry made roads for themselves
directly through the fields.</p>

<p>The whole army marches surrounded by "advance and
rear guards," and "flankers," to prevent surprise. Each
column is headed by a corps of pioneers who, in addition
to their arms, are provided with axes, picks and shovels,
with the latter stone walls and fences are levelled sufficiently
to permit the troops to pass, and ditches and other
obstructions covered and removed. It is interesting to see
how quickly this corps will dispose of an ordinary stone
wall or rail fence. They go down so quickly that they
hardly seem to pause in their march.</p>

<p>We learn that the Johnnies are only a couple of days
ahead of us. That they marched rapidly and were on their
good behavior, all marauding being forbidden, and they
were singing a new song, entitled "My Maryland," thus
trying to woo this loyal border State over to the Confederacy.
We were told that Lee hung two soldiers for
stealing chickens and fruit just before they entered Frederick
City.</p>

<p>Much could be written about the discomforts of these
marches, the chief of which was the dust more than the
heat and the fatigue. No rain had fallen for some time,
and the roads and the fields through which we passed were
powdered into fine dust, which arose in almost suffocating
clouds, so that mouth, lungs, eyes, and ears were filled with
it. Sometimes it became so dense that men could not be
seen a dozen yards away. The different regiments took
turns in heading the columns. There was comparative
comfort at the head, but there were so many regiments that
during the whole campaign our regiment enjoyed this
privilege but once.</p>

<p>Another feature of the march was inability to satisfy
thirst. The dust and heat no doubt produced an abnormal
thirst which water did not seem to satisfy. The water we
could get was always warm, and generally muddy and
filthy. The latter was caused by the multitude of men
using the little streams, springs, or wells. Either of these,
ordinarily abundant for many more than ever used them,
were hardly a cup full apiece for a great army. Hence
many a scrimmage took place for the first dash at a cool
well or spring. On our second or third day's march, such
a scrap took place between the advanced columns for a
well, and in the mêlée one man was accidentally pushed
down into it, head first, and killed. He belonged to one of
the Connecticut regiments, I was told. We passed by the
well, and were unable to get water, because a dead soldier
lay at the bottom of it. His regiment probably got his
body out, but we had to march on without stopping to
learn whether they did or not. The problem of water for
our army we found to be a troublesome one. Immediately
we halted, much of our rest would be taken up in efforts to
get water. We lost no opportunity to fill our canteens.
Arriving in bivouac for the night, the first thing was a
detail to fill canteens and camp kettles for supper coffee.
We always bivouacked near a stream, if possible. But,
then, so many men wanting it soon roiled it for miles, so
that our details often had to follow the stream up three
and four miles before they could get clean water. This
may seem a strong statement, but if one will stop a
moment and think of the effect upon even a good-sized
stream, of a hundred thousand men, besides horses and
mules, all wanting it for drinking, cooking, washing, and
bathing (both the latter as peremptory needs as the former),
he will see that the statement is no exaggeration.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of our first two days' march was
the clearing out of knapsacks to reduce the load. Naturally
each man was loaded with extras of various sorts,
knicknacks of all varieties, but mostly supposed necessaries
of camp life, put in by loving hands at home, a salve for
this, a medicine for that, a keepsake from one and another,
some the dearest of earth's treasures, each insignificant
in itself, yet all taking room and adding weight to over-burdened
shoulders. At the mid-day halt, on the first day
knapsacks being off for rest, they came open and the
sorting began. It was sad, yet comical withal, to notice the
things that went out. The most bulky and least treasured
went first. At the second halting, an hour later, still another
sorting was made. The sun was hot and the knapsack
was heavy. After the second day's march, those
knapsacks contained little but what the soldier was compelled
to carry, his rations, extra ammunition, and clothing.
Were these home treasures lost? Oh, no! Not one. Our
friends, the vets, gathered them all in as a rich harvest.
They had been there themselves, and knowing what was
coming, were on hand to gather the plums as they fell.
The only difference was, that another mother's or sweetheart's
"boy" got the treasures.</p>

<p>On September 11 we were approaching Frederick City.
Our cavalry had a skirmish with the rebel cavalry, showing
that we were nearing their army. And right here I
ought to say that what an individual officer or soldier&mdash;unless
perhaps a general officer&mdash;knows of events transpiring
around him in the army is very little. Even the
movements he sees, he is seldom able to understand, his
vision is so limited. He knows what his own regiment and
possibly his own brigade does, but seldom more than that.
He is as often the victim of false rumor as to movements
of other portions of the army, as those who are outside
of it. On this date we encamped near Clarksville. It was
rumored that the rebels were in force at Frederick City.
How far away that is we do not know. The only certainty
about army life and army movements to the soldier is a
constant condition of uncertainty. Uncertainty as to
where or when he will eat, sleep, or fight, where or when
the end will come. One would almost doubt the certainty
of his own existence, except for the hard knocks which
make this impossible.</p>

<p>The celebrated Irish brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General
Thomas Francis Meagher, was in Richardson's
division. They were a "free and easy" going crowd.
General Richardson impressed me as a man of great determination
and courage. He was a large, heavy man,
dressed roughly and spoke and acted very brusquely.
French (who commanded our division) was also thick-set,
probably upwards of sixty years old, quite gray and with a
very red face. He had an affection of the eyes which kept
him winking or blinking constantly, from which he earned
the sobriquet, "Old Blink Eye." I saw General Burnside
about this time. He was dressed so as to be almost unrecognizable
as a general officer; wore a rough blouse, on
the collar of which a close look revealed two much-battered
and faded stars, indicating his rank of major-general.
He wore a black "slouch" hat, the brim well
down over his face, and rode along with a single orderly,
without the least ostentation. The men of the other regiments
knew him and broke out into a cheer, at which he
promptly doffed his hat and swung it at the boys. His
hat off, we recognized the handsome author of the "Burnside"
whiskers. He was not only very popular with his
own corps&mdash;the Ninth&mdash;but with the whole army, and
chiefly, I think, because of his modest, quiet way of going
about. This was so different from General McClellan.</p>

<p>On our third day's march we were halted for rest, when
an orderly rode through the lines saying to the different
colonels, "General McClellan will pass this way in ten
minutes." This meant that we were to be ready to cheer
"Little Mac" when he came along, which, of course, we
all did. He came, preceded by a squadron of cavalry and
accompanied by a very large and brilliantly caparisoned
staff, followed by more cavalry. He was dressed in the
full uniform of a major-general and rode a superb horse,
upon which he sat faultlessly. He was certainly a fine-looking
officer and a very striking figure. But whether all
this "fuss and feathers" was designed to impress the men,
or was a freak of personal vanity, it did not favorably impress
our men. Many of the old vets, who had been with
him on the Peninsula, and now greeted him again after his
reinstatement, were very enthusiastic. But notwithstanding
their demonstrations, they rather negatived their
praises by the remark, "No fight to-day; Little Mac has
gone to the front." "Look out for a fight when he goes
to the rear." On the other hand, they said when "Old
Man Sumner"&mdash;our corps commander&mdash;"goes to the
front, look out for a fight."</p>

<p>General Sumner was an old man&mdash;must have been
nearly seventy&mdash;gray, and his color indicated advanced
age, though he seemed quite vigorous. He went about
very quietly and without display. He had a singular
habit of dropping his under jaw, so that his mouth was
partially open much of the time.</p>

<p>We bivouacked on the 12th of September in front of
Frederick City, Md., in a field occupied the night before
by the rebels, so the people told us, and there was abundant
evidence of their presence in the filth they left uncovered,
for they had slaughtered beef for their troops and the
putrid offal therefrom was polluting the air. Still there
we had to sleep. We marched the latter part of the day in
the rain, and were soon well covered with mud. We managed
to keep some of the water out with our gum blankets,
and when we came to fix for the night, the men going in
pairs made themselves fairly comfortable under their
shelter tents. I should have explained that the only "canvas"
supplied to the men on the march was shelter tents,
which consisted of a square of stout muslin with button-holes
on one side and buttons on the other. Two of these
buttoned together and stretched taut over a ridge-pole and
made fast on the ground, would keep out the heaviest
shower, provided the occupants were careful not to touch
the muslin. A hand or elbow accidentally thrust against
the tent brought the water through in streams. There is a
knack in doing this, which the experience of the vets with
whom we were brigaded soon taught us. Choosing
ground a little slanting, so the water would run away from
them, they would sleep fairly dry and comfortable, even in
a hard storm. As for us officers who were without shelter
tents, we had to shift for ourselves as best we might. A
favorite plan, when fences were available, was to place
three or four rails endwise against the fence and make
a shelter by fastening a gum blanket on top.</p>

<p>This worked fairly well against a stone wall for a backing,
but against an ordinary fence one side was unprotected,
yet with another gum blanket, two of us could so
roll ourselves up as to be comparatively water-proof. My
diary states that in a driving rainstorm here I never slept
better in my life. I remember awakening with my head
thoroughly drenched, but otherwise comparatively dry.</p>

<p>This night I succeeded in getting a "bang up" supper&mdash;a
cooked meal&mdash;at a reb farm-house. It consisted of pork-steak,
potatoes, and hot coffee with bread and butter. It
was a great treat. I had now been without a square meal
for nearly ten days. The old gentleman, a small farmer,
talked freely about the war, not concealing his rebel sympathies.
He extolled Stonewall Jackson and his men,
who, he said, had passed through there only a day ahead of
us. He firmly believed we would be whipped. He evidently
had an eye for the "main chance," for he was quite
willing to cook for us at twenty-five cents a meal, as long
as he had stuff to cook and his good wife had strength
to do the work. She seemed to be a nice old lady, and,
hungry as I was, I felt almost unwilling to eat her supper,
she looked so tired. I told her it was too bad. She smiled
and said she was tired, but she couldn't bear to turn away
these hungry boys. She said she had a son in the rebel
army, and she knew we must be hungry and wet, for it
was still raining hard.</p>

<p>The officers at this time experienced difficulty in getting
food to eat. The men were supplied with rations and
forced to carry them, but rations were not issued to officers&mdash;though
they might purchase of the commissary such as
the men had, when there was a supply. The latter were
supposed to provide their own mess, for which purpose
their mess-kits were transported in a wagon supplied to
each regiment. The field and staff usually made one mess,
and the line or company officers another. Sometimes the
latter messed with their own men, carrying their rations
along on the march the same as the men. This was discouraged
by the government, but it proved the only way
to be sure of food when needed, and was later on generally
adopted. We had plenty of food with our mess-kit and
cook, but on the march, and especially in the presence of
the enemy, our wagons could never get within reach of
us. Indeed, when we bivouacked, they were generally
from eight to ten miles away. The result was we often
went hungry, unless we were able to pick up a meal at a
farm-house&mdash;which seldom occurred, for the reason that
most of these farmers were rebel sympathizers and would
not feed us "Yanks," or they would be either sold out, or
stolen out, of food. The tale generally told was, "You
'uns has stolen all we 'uns had." This accounts for the
entry in my diary that the next morning I marched without
breakfast, but got a good bath in the Monocacy&mdash;near
which we encamped&mdash;in place of it. I got a "hardtack"
and bit of raw pork about 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>On the 13th of September, we passed through the city of
Frederick, Md. It is a quaint old town, having then probably
three thousand or more inhabitants and a decided
business air. The rebels, they claimed, had cleaned them
out of eatables and clothing, paying for them in Confederate
scrip, and one man told me they would not
take the same scrip in change, but required Union money;
that this was demanded everywhere. General McClellan
passed through the streets while we were halted, as did
General Burnside shortly after. A funny incident occurred
with the latter. General Burnside, as usual, was
accompanied by a single orderly, and had stopped a moment
to speak to some officers, when a handsome, middle-aged
lady stepped out of her house and approached. She
put out her hand and, as the general clasped it, she raised
herself up on her toes in an unmistakable motion to
greet him with a kiss.</p>

<p>The general so understood her, and, doffing his hat, bent
down to meet her pouting lips, but, alas, he was too high
up; bend as low as he might and stretch up as high as she
could, their lips did not meet, and the kiss hung in mid-air.
The boys caught the situation in a moment, and began to
laugh and clap their hands, but the general solved the
problem by dismounting and taking his kiss in the most
gallant fashion, on which he was roundly cheered by the
men. The lady was evidently of one of the best families.
She said she was a stanch Union woman, and was so glad
to see our troops that she felt she must greet our general.
There was "method in her madness," however, for she
confined her favors to a general, and picked out the handsomest
one of the lot. It is worthy of note, that during
this incident, which excited uproarious laughter, not a disrespectful
remark was made by any of the hundreds of our
"boys" who witnessed it. General Burnside chatted with
her for a few moments, then remounted and rode away.</p>

<p>Approaching Frederick City, the country is exceptionally
beautiful and the land seemed to be under a good state
of cultivation. In front of us loomed up almost against
the sky the long ridge called the South Mountain. It was
evidently a spur of the Blue Ridge. Another incident occurred
soon after reaching bivouac, just beyond the city.
We had arranged for our night's "lodging" and were preparing
supper, when one of the native farmers came into
camp and asked to see the colonel. Colonel Oakford and
Lieutenant-Colonel Wilcox were temporarily absent, and
he was turned over to Major Albright, to whom he complained
that "you 'uns" had stolen his last pig and he
wanted pay for it. The major, who was a lawyer, began
to cross-question him as to how he knew it was our men
who had stolen it; there were at least fifty other regiments
besides ours on the ground. But he would not be denied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;"><a name="ALBRIGHT" id="ALBRIGHT"></a>
<img src="images/gs06_th.png" width="358" height="550" alt="COLONEL CHARLES ALBRIGHT" />
<span class="caption">COLONEL CHARLES ALBRIGHT<br /><a href="images/gs06.png">(see image enlarged)</a></span>
</div>

<p>He said they told him they was "a hundred and thirty-two
uns," and he also saw those figures on their caps. The
major asked how long ago they took it. He replied that
they got it only a little while ago, and offered to go and
find it if the major would allow him. But the latter was
confident he was mistaken in his men&mdash;that some of the
old "vets" had got his pig. His chief argument was that
our men were greenhorns and knew nothing about marauding;
that some of the "vets" had doubtless made
away with his pig and had laid it on our men. So persuasive
was the major that the man finally went off satisfied
that he had made a mistake in his men. The man was
only well out of camp when one of our men appeared at
the major's quarters with a piece of fresh pork for his
supper, with the compliments of Company&mdash;&mdash;. Now,
the orders against marauding were very severe, and to
have been caught would have involved heavy punishment.
But the chief point of the incident, and which made it a
huge joke on the major, lay in the fact that the latter who
was a thoroughly conscientious man, had successfully
fought off a charge against his men, whom he really believed
to be innocent, only to find that during the very
time he was persuading his man of their innocence, the
scamps were almost within sound of his voice, actually
butchering and dressing the pig. How they managed to
capture and kill that pig, without a single squeal escaping,
is one of the marvels of the service. Certainly vets could
have done no better. The man was gone, the mischief was
done, the meat was spoiling, and we were very hungry.
With rather cheerful sadness, it must be confessed, we became
<i>particeps criminis</i>, and made a supper on the pork.</p>

<p class="c smcap">DRAWING NEAR THE ENEMY&mdash;BATTLE OF SOUTH MOUNTAIN&mdash;PRELIMINARY
SKIRMISHES</p>


<p>S<span class="smcap">unday</span>, September 15, we broke camp at daylight and
marched out on the Hagerstown "pike." Our division had
the field this day. We crossed the ridge in rear of Frederick
City and thence down into and up a most beautiful
valley. We made only about seven miles, though we
actually marched over twelve. We were in the presence
of the enemy and were man&oelig;uvred so as to keep concealed.
We heard heavy cannonading all day, and part
of the time could see our batteries, towards which we
were marching.</p>

<p>Towards night we heard the first musketry firing. It
proved to be the closing of the short but sanguinary battle
of South Mountain. General Reno, commanding the
Ninth Corps, whose glistening bayonets we had seen
across the valley ahead of us, had overtaken the rebel
rear guard in South Mountain pass and a severe action
had ensued. General Reno himself was killed. His body
was brought back next morning in an ambulance on its
way to Washington. We reached the battle-ground about
midnight, whither we had been hurried as supports. The
batteries on both sides were still at work, but musketry
firing had ceased. It had been a beautiful though very
warm day, and the night was brilliantly moonlight, one
of those exceptionally bright nights which almost equalled
daylight. And this had been Sunday&mdash;the Lord's day!
How dreadful the work for the Lord's day!</p>

<p>Here I saw the first dead soldier. Two of our artillerymen
had been killed while serving their gun. Both were
terribly mangled. They had been laid aside, while others
stepped into their places. There they still lay, horrible
evidence of the "hell of war." Subsequently I saw thousands
of the killed on both sides, which made scarcely
more impression on me than so many logs, but this first
vision of the awful work of war still remains. Even at
this writing, forty years later, memory reproduces that
horrible scene as clearly as on that beautiful Sabbath
evening.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when we bivouacked for the little
rest we were to have before resuming the "chase." Being
now in the immediate "presence of the enemy," we
rested on "our arms," that is, every soldier lay down
with his gun at his side, and knapsack and accoutrements
ready to be "slung" immediately on the sounding of the
"call." We officers did not unsaddle our horses, but dismounted
and snatched an hour's sleep just as we were.
Bright and early next morning we were on our way again.
It was a most beautiful morning.</p>

<p>We soon passed the field where the musketry did its
work the night before, and there were more than a
hundred dead rebels scattered over the field, as the result of
it. Two or three were sitting upright, or nearly so,
against stumps. They had evidently been mortally
wounded, and died while waiting for help. All were
dressed in coarse butternut-colored stuffs, very ugly in
appearance, but admirably well calculated to conceal them
from our troops.</p>

<p>We rapidly passed over the mountain (South Mountain)
and down into the village of Boonsborough. There
was abundant evidence of the rebel skedaddle down the
mountain ahead of our troops in the way of blankets,
knapsacks, and other impedimenta, evidently dropped or
thrown away in the flight. We passed several squads
of rebel prisoners who had been captured by our cavalry
and were being marched to the rear under guard. They
were good-looking boys, apparently scarcely more than
boys, and were poorly dressed and poorly supplied.</p>

<p>Some freely expressed themselves as glad they had been
captured, as they were sick of the fighting.</p>

<p>My own experiences this day were a taste of "the
front," that is, the excitement attending a momentarily
expected "brush" with the enemy. Part of the time my
heart was in my mouth, and my hair seemed to stand
straight up. One can have little idea of this feeling until
it has been experienced. Any effort to describe it will
be inadequate. Personal fear? Yes, that unquestionably
is at the bottom of it, and I take no stock in the man who
says he has no fear. We had been without food until
late in the afternoon for reasons heretofore explained.
Towards night one of my friends in Company K gave me
a cup of coffee and a "hardtack."</p>

<p>Just before reaching Boonsborough, a pretty village
nestling at the foot of the South Mountain, our cavalry
had a sharp skirmish with the rebel rear-guard, in which
Captain Kelley, of the Illinois cavalry, was killed, I was
told. At Boonsborough we found the field hospitals with
the rebel wounded from the fight of the day previous.
Their wounded men said their loss was over four hundred
killed, among them two brigadiers-general, one colonel,
and several officers of lesser rank. A rebel flag of truce
came into our lines here to get the bodies of these dead
officers and to arrange for burying their dead and caring
for their wounded. The houses of Boonsborough had
been mostly vacated by the people on the approach of the
rebel army and the fighting, and the latter had promptly
occupied as many of them as they needed for their
wounded. Imagine these poor villagers returning from
their flight to find their homes literally packed with
wounded rebel soldiers and their attendants. Whatever
humble food supplies they may have had, all had been
appropriated, for war spares nothing. Some of the
frightened people of the village were returning as we
passed through, and were sadly lamenting the destruction
of almost everything that could be destroyed on and
about their homes by this besom of destruction,&mdash;war.
Food, stock, fences, bed and bedding, etc., all gone or
destroyed. Some of the houses had been perforated by
the shells,&mdash;probably our own shells, aimed at the enemy.
One man told me a shell had entered his house and landed
on the bed in the front room, but had not exploded. Had
it exploded, he would have had a bigger story to tell.</p>

<p>The rebels, we learned, had been gone but a few hours,
and we were kept in pursuit. We marched out the Shepherdstown
road a few miles, reaching and passing through
another village&mdash;Keedysville. We were continuously
approaching heavy cannonading. Indeed, we had been
marching for the past three days within hearing of, and
drawing closer to, the artillery barking of the two armies.
Old vets said this meant a big fight within the next few
hours. If so, I thought I shall better know how to diagnose
similar symptoms in the future.</p>

<p>A mile beyond Keedysville we bivouacked for the
night, after a hard, hot, and exciting day's chase. Lieutenant-Colonel
Wilcox came into camp with a great
trophy, nothing less than a good old-fashioned fat loaf
of home-made bread. He was immediately voted a niche
in the future hall of fame, for two acts of extraordinary
merit, namely, first, finding and capturing the bread, and,
second, bringing it into camp intact, the latter act being
considered supremely self-sacrificing. It was magnanimously
divided by him, and made a supper for three of
us. Our mid-day meal had been made up of dust and
excitement.</p>

<p>All sorts of rumors were afloat as to the movements
of the enemy, as well as of our own army. It was said
Jackson was across the Potomac with a large force; that
Hooker was engaging him, and that we were likely to
bag the balance of Lee's army soon. One thing I learned,
namely, that I could be sure only of what I saw, and that
was very little, indeed, of the doings of either army. The
soldier who professes to know all about army movements
because he "was there," may be set down either as a
bummer, who spent most of his time up trees, safely ensconced
where he could see, or as a fake.</p>

</div>

<p>My diary records a night of good rest September 16,
1862, in this camp on the Shepherdstown road. The morning
was clear, beautiful, and cheery. This entry will look
somewhat remarkable in view of that which follows,
namely, "No breakfast in sight or in prospect." Later
one of our men gave me half his cup of coffee and a
couple of small sweet potatoes, which I roasted and ate
without seasoning.</p>

<p>The "ball" opened soon after daylight by a rebel battery,
about three-quarters of a mile away, attempting to
shell our lines. Our division was massed under the shelter
of a hill. One of our batteries of 12-pounder brass
guns promptly replied, and a beautiful artillery duel
ensued, the first I had ever witnessed at close quarters.
Many of us crept up to the brow of the hill to see the
"fun," though we were warned that we were courting
trouble in so doing. We could see columns of rebel infantry
marching in ranks of four, just as we marched,
en route, and as shell after shell from our guns would
explode among them and scatter and kill we would cheer.
We were enjoying ourselves hugely until presently some
additional puffs of smoke appeared from their side, followed
immediately by a series of very ugly hissing, whizzing
sounds, and the dropping of shells amongst our
troops which changed the whole aspect of things. Our
merriment and cheering were replaced by a scurrying to
cover, with blanched faces on some and an ominous,
thoughtful quiet over all.</p>

<p>This was really our first baptism of fire, for though at
South Mountain we had been in range and were credited
with being in the fight as supports, none of the shells had
actually visited us. Several of these came altogether too
close for comfort. Colonel Oakford, Lieutenant-Colonel
Wilcox, and I were sitting on our horses as close together
as horses ordinarily stand, when one of these ugly missiles
dropped down between us. It came with a shrieking,
screeching sound, like the pitch of an electric car with
the added noise of a dozen sky-rockets. It did not explode.
It created considerable consternation and no little
stir with horses and men, but did no damage further than
the scare and a good showering of gravel and dust. Another
struck between the ranks of our brigade as they were
resting under the hill with guns stacked,&mdash;only a few feet
away from us. It also, happily, failed to explode, but
we were sure some one must have been killed by it. It
did not seem possible that such a missile could drop down
upon a division of troops in mass without hitting somebody;
but, strange as it may seem, it did no damage
beyond knocking down a row of gun-stacks and tumbling
topsy-turvy several men, who were badly bruised, but
otherwise uninjured. The way the concussion tossed the
men about was terrific. Had these shells exploded, some
other body would probably have had to write up this narrative.</p>

<p>Another shell incident occurred during this artillery
duel that looked very funny, though it was anything but
funny to the poor fellow who suffered. He, with others,
had been up near our battery, on the knoll just above us,
witnessing the firing, when one of these rebel shells came
ricochetting along the ground towards him as he evidently
thought, for he started to run down the hill thinking to
get away from it, but in fact running exactly in front of
the shell, which carried away one heel. He continued
down the hill at greatly accelerated speed, but now hopping
on one foot. Had he remained where he was the missile
would have passed him harmlessly. Except when
nearly spent, shells are not seen until they have passed,
but the screeching, whizzing, hissing noise is sufficient to
make one believe they are hunting him personally. Veteran
troops get to discount the terrors of these noises in a
measure, and pay little attention to them, on the theory
that if one is going to be hit by them he will be anyway,
and no amount of dodging will save him, so they go right
on and "take their chances." But with new troops the
effect of a shell shrieking over or past them is often very
ludicrous. An involuntary salaam follows the first sound,
with a wild craning of the necks to see where it went.
Upon marching troops, the effect is like that of a puff of
wind chasing a wave across a field of grain.</p>

<p>Returning to our artillery duel, so far as we could
judge, our battery had the best of the practice, but not
without paying the price, for the second rebel shell killed
the major (chief of artillery of our division), who sat on
his horse directing the fire, and besides there were a number
of casualties among the battery men. I had seen many
a battery practice on parade occasions with blank cartridges.
How utterly different was the thing in war. Infinitely
more savage, the noise deafeningly multiplied, each
gun, regardless of the others, doing its awful worst to spit
out and hurl as from the mouth of a hell-born dragon these
missiles of death at the enemy.</p>

<p>The duel continued for upwards of two hours, until the
enemy's battery hauled off, having apparently had enough.
Evidences of the conflict were sadly abundant. A number
were killed, others wounded and several of the battery
horses were killed. The work of the men in this hell of
fire was magnificent. They never flagged for a moment,
and at the conclusion were not in the least disabled, notwithstanding
their losses. I think it was Nimm's battery
from Pittsburg. This was the chief incident of the day.
It was said the two armies were man&oelig;uvring for position,
and that a great battle was imminent. This from my
diary. It proved to be true, and that all the skirmishes
and "affaires" for the preceding ten days had been only
preliminary to the great battle of Antietam, fought on the
next day, the 17th.</p>

<p>We remained in bivouac here the remainder of the day
and night. Burnside's Ninth Corps passed to "the front"
during the afternoon, a splendid body of veteran troops,
whose handsome and popular general was heartily
cheered. He was a large, heavily-built man, and sat his
handsome horse like a prince.</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM</p>


<p>N<span class="smcap">ever</span> did day open more beautiful. We were astir at
the first streak of dawn. We had slept, and soundly too,
just where nightfall found us under the shelter of the hill
near Keedysville. No reveille call this morning. Too
close to the enemy. Nor was this needed to arouse us. A
simple call of a sergeant or corporal and every man was
instantly awake and alert. All realized that there was
ugly business and plenty of it just ahead. This was
plainly visible in the faces as well as in the nervous, subdued
demeanor of all. The absence of all joking and play
and the almost painful sobriety of action, where jollity had
been the rule, was particularly noticeable.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the events of the battle, I should
speak of the "night before the battle," of which so much
has been said and written. My diary says that Lieutenant-Colonel
Wilcox, Captain James Archbald, Co. I, and
I slept together, sharing our blankets; that it rained during
the night; this fact, with the other, that we were close
friends at home, accounts for our sharing blankets. Three
of us with our gum blankets could so arrange as to keep
fairly dry, notwithstanding the rain.</p>

<p>The camp was ominously still this night. We were not
allowed to sing or make any noise, nor have any fires&mdash;except
just enough to make coffee&mdash;for fear of attracting
the fire of the enemies' batteries. But there was no need
of such an inhibition as to singing or frolicking, for there
was no disposition to indulge in either. Unquestionably,
the problems of the morrow were occupying all breasts.
Letters were written home&mdash;many of them "last words"&mdash;and
quiet talks were had, and promises made between
comrades. Promises providing against the dreaded
possibilities of the morrow. "If the worst happens, Jack."
"Yes, Ned, send word to mother and to&mdash;&mdash;, and these;
she will prize them," and so directions were interchanged
that meant so much.</p>

<p>I can never forget the quiet words of Colonel Oakford,
as he inquired very particularly if my roster of the officers
and men of the regiment was complete, for, said he, with a
smile, "We shall not all be here to-morrow night."</p>

<p>Now to resume the story of the battle. We were on the
march about six o'clock and moved, as I thought, rather
leisurely for upwards of two miles, crossing Antietam
creek, which our men waded nearly waist deep, emerging,
of course, soaked through, our first experience of this kind.
It was a hot morning and, therefore, the only ill effects of
this wading was the discomfort to the men of marching
with soaked feet. It was now quite evident that a great
battle was in progress. A deafening pandemonium of
cannonading, with shrieking and bursting shells, filled the
air beyond us, towards which we were marching. An occasional
shell whizzed by or over, reminding us that we
were rapidly approaching the "debatable ground." Soon
we began to hear a most ominous sound which we had
never before heard, except in the far distance at South
Mountain, namely, the rattle of musketry. It had none
of the deafening bluster of the cannonading so terrifying
to new troops, but to those who had once experienced its
effect, it was infinitely more to be dreaded. The fatalities
by musketry at close quarters, as the two armies fought
at Antietam and all through the Civil War, as compared
with those by artillery, are at least as 100 to 1, probably
much more than that.</p>

<p>These volleys of musketry we were approaching
sounded in the distance like the rapid pouring of shot upon
a tinpan, or the tearing of heavy canvas, with slight
pauses interspersed with single shots, or desultory shooting.
All this presaged fearful work in store for us, with
what results to each personally the future, measured probably
by moments, would reveal.</p>

<p>How does one feel under such conditions? To tell the
truth, I realized the situation most keenly and felt very
uncomfortable. Lest there might be some undue manifestation
of this feeling in my conduct, I said to myself,
this is the duty I undertook to perform for my country,
and now I'll do it, and leave the results with God. My
greater fear was not that I might be killed, but that I
might be grievously wounded and left a victim of suffering
on the field.</p>

<p>The nervous strain was plainly visible upon all of us.
All moved doggedly forward in obedience to orders, in absolute
silence so far as talking was concerned. The compressed
lip and set teeth showed that nerve and resolution
had been summoned to the discharge of duty. A few
temporarily fell out, unable to endure the nervous strain,
which was simply awful. There were a few others, it
must be said, who skulked, took counsel of their cowardly
legs, and, despite all efforts of "file closers" and officers,
left the ranks. Of these two classes most of the first rejoined
us later on, and their dropping out was no reflection
on their bravery. The nervous strain produced by the
excitement and danger gave them the malady called by
the vets, the "cannon quickstep."</p>

<p>On our way into "position" we passed the "Meyer
Spring,"&mdash;a magnificent fountain of sweet spring water.
It was walled in, and must have been ten or twelve feet
square and at least three feet deep, and a stream was flowing
from it large enough to make a respectable brook.
Many of us succeeded in filling our canteens from this
glorious spring, now surrounded by hundreds of wounded
soldiers. What a Godsend it was to those poor fellows.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock we were formed into line of battle
and moved forward through a grove of trees,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-A" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote A.">[A]</a> but before
actually coming under musketry fire of the enemy we were
moved back again, and swung around nearly a mile to the
left to the base of a circular knoll to the left of the Roulette
farm-house and the road which leads up to the
Sharpsburg pike, near the Dunkard church. The famous
"sunken road"&mdash;a road which had been cut through the
other side of this knoll&mdash;extended from the Roulette Lane
directly in front of our line towards Sharpsburg. I had
ridden by the side of Colonel Oakford, except when on
duty, up and down the column, and as the line was formed
by the colonel and ordered forward, we dismounted and
sent our horses to the rear by a servant. I was immediately
sent by the colonel to the left of the line to assist
in getting that into position. A rail fence separated us
from the top of the knoll. Bullets were whizzing and
singing by our ears, but so far hitting none where I was.
Over the fence and up the knoll in an excellent line we
went. In the centre of the knoll, perhaps a third of the
way up, was a large tree, and under and around this tree
lay a body of troops doing nothing. They were in our
way, but our orders were forward, and through and over
them we went.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;"><a name="OAK" id="OAK"></a>

<span class="caption">COLONEL RICHARD A. OAKFORD<br />
Killed at battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862<br /><a href="images/gs08.png">(see image enlarged)</a></span>
</div>

<p>Reaching the top of the knoll we were met by a terrific
volley from the rebels in the sunken road down the other
side, not more than one hundred yards away, and also
from another rebel line in a corn-field just beyond. Some
of our men were killed and wounded by this volley. We
were ordered to lie down just under the top of the hill and
crawl forward and fire over, each man crawling back, reloading
his piece in this prone position and again crawling
forward and firing. These tactics undoubtedly saved us
many lives, for the fire of the two lines in front of us was
terrific. The air was full of whizzing, singing, buzzing
bullets. Once down on the ground under cover of the
hill, it required very strong resolution to get up where
these missiles of death were flying so thickly, yet that was
the duty of us officers, especially us of the field and staff.
My duty kept me constantly moving up and down that
whole line.</p>

<p>On my way back to the right of the line, where I had
left Colonel Oakford, I met Lieutenant-Colonel Wilcox,
who told me the terrible news that Colonel Oakford was
killed. Of the details of his death, I had no time then to
inquire. We were then in the very maelstrom of the
battle. Men were falling every moment. The horrible
noise of the battle was incessant and almost deafening.
Except that my mind was so absorbed in my duties, I do
not know how I could have endured the strain. Yet out
of this pandemonium memory brings several remarkable
incidents. They came and went with the rapidity of a
quickly revolving kaleidoscope. You caught stupendous
incidents on the instant, and in an instant they had passed.
One was the brave death of the major of this regiment
that was lying idle under the tree. The commanding
officer evidently was not doing his duty, and this major
was endeavoring to rally his men and get them at work.
He was swinging his hat and cheering his men forward,
when a solid shot decapitated him. His poor body went
down as though some giant had picked it up and furiously
slammed it on the ground, and I was so near him that I
could almost have touched him with my sword.</p>

<p>The inaction of this regiment lying behind us under that
tree was very demoralizing to our men, setting them a bad
example. General Kimball, who commanded our brigade,
was seated on his horse just under the knoll in the rear of
our regiment, evidently watching our work, and he signalled
me to come to him, and then gave me orders to
present his compliments to the commanding officer of that
regiment and direct him to get his men up and at work.
I communicated this order as directed. The colonel was
hugging the ground, and merely turned his face towards
me without replying or attempting to obey the order.
General Kimball saw the whole thing, and again called
me to him and, with an oath, commanded me to repeat
the order to him at the muzzle of my revolver, and shoot
him if he did not immediately obey. Said General Kimball:
"Get those cowards out of there or shoot them."
My task was a most disagreeable one, but I must deliver
my orders, and did so, but was saved the duty of shooting
by the other officers of the regiment bravely rallying their
men and pushing them forward to the firing-line, where
they did good work. What became of that skulking colonel,
I do not know.</p>

<p>The air was now thick with smoke from the muskets,
which not only obscured our vision of the enemy, but made
breathing difficult and most uncomfortable. The day was
excessively hot, and no air stirring, we were forced to
breathe this powder smoke, impregnated with saltpetre,
which burned the coating of nose, throat, and eyes almost
like fire.</p>

<p>Captain Abbott, commanding Company G, from Mauch
Chunk, a brave and splendid officer, was early carried to
the rear, a ball having nearly carried away his under jaw.
He afterwards told me that his first sensation of this awful
wound was his mouth full of blood, teeth, and splintered
bones, which he spat out on the ground, and then found
that unless he got immediate help he would bleed to death
in a few minutes. Fortunately he found Assistant Surgeon
Hoover, who had been assigned to us just from his
college graduation, who, under the shelter of a hay-stack,
with no anæsthetic, performed an operation which Dr.
Gross, of Philadelphia, afterwards said had been but once
before successfully performed in the history of surgery,
and saved his life. Lieutenant Anson C. Cranmer, Company
C, was killed, and the ground was soon strewn with
the dead and wounded. Soon our men began to call for
more ammunition, and we officers were kept busy taking
from the dead and wounded and distributing to the
living. Each man had eighty rounds when we began the
fight. One man near me rose a moment, when a missile
struck his gun about midway, and actually capsized him.
He pulled himself together, and, finding he was only a
little bruised, picked up another gun, with which the
ground was now strewn, and went at it again.</p>

<p>Directly, a lull in the enemy's firing occurred, and we
had an opportunity to look over the hill a little more carefully
at their lines. Their first line in the sunken road
seemed to be all dead or wounded, and several of our men
ran down there, to find that literally true. They brought
back the lieutenant-colonel, a fine-looking man, who was
mortally wounded. I shook his hand, and he said, "God
bless you, boys, you are very kind." He asked to be laid
down in some sheltered place, for, said he, "I have but a
few moments to live." I well remember his refined, gentlemanly
appearance, and how profoundly sorry I felt for
him. He was young, lithely built, of sandy complexion,
and wore a comparatively new uniform of Confederate
gray, on which was embroidered the insignia of the "5th
Ga.,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-B" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote B.">[B]</a> C. S. A." He said, "You have killed all my brave
boys; they are there in the road." And they were, I saw
them next day lying four deep in places as they fell, a
most awful picture of battle carnage. This lull was of
very short duration, and like the lull of a storm presaged
a renewal of the firing with greater fury, for a fresh line
of rebel troops had been brought up. This occurred three
times before we were relieved.</p>

</div>

<p>During the fiercest of the firing, another remarkable incident
occurred, which well illustrated the fortunes of war.
I heard a man shouting, "Come over here men, you can
see 'em better," and there, over the brow of the knoll, absolutely
exposed, was Private George Coursen, of Company
K, sitting on a boulder, loading and firing as calmly
as though there wasn't a rebel in the country. I yelled to
him to come back under the cover of the hill-top, but he
said he could see the rebels better there, and refused to
leave his vantage-ground. I think he remained there
until we were ordered back and did not receive a scratch.
His escape was nothing less than a miracle. He seemed
to have no idea of fear.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact about our experience during this
fight was that we took no note of time. When we were
out of ammunition and about to move back I looked at my
watch and found it was 12.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> We had been under
fire since eight o'clock. I couldn't believe my eyes; was
sure my watch had gone wrong. I would have sworn
that we had not been there more than twenty minutes,
when we had actually been in that very hell of fire for four
and a half hours.</p>

<p>Just as we were moving back, the Irish brigade came
up, under command of General Thomas Francis Meagher.
They had been ordered to complete our work by a charge,
and right gallantly they did it. Many of our men, not
understanding the order, joined in that charge. General
Meagher rode a beautiful white horse, but made a show of
himself by tumbling off just as he reached our line. The
boys said he was drunk, and he certainly looked and acted
like a drunken man. He regained his feet and floundered
about, swearing like a crazy man. The brigade, however,
made a magnificent charge and swept everything before it.</p>

<p>Another incident occurred during the time we were
under fire. My attention was arrested by a heavily built
general officer passing to the rear on foot. He came close
by me and as he passed he shouted: "You will have to
get back. Don't you see yonder line of rebels is flanking
you?" I looked in the direction he pointed, and, sure
enough, on our right and now well to our rear was an
extended line of rebel infantry with their colors flying,
moving forward almost with the precision of a parade.
They had thrown forward a beautiful skirmish line and
seemed to be practically masters of the situation. My
heart was in my mouth for a couple of moments, until
suddenly the picture changed, and their beautiful line
collapsed and went back as if the d&mdash;l was after them.
They had run up against an obstruction in a line of the
"boys in blue," and many of them never went back.
This general officer who spoke to me, I learned, was
Major-General Richardson, commanding the First Division,
then badly wounded, and who died a few hours
after.</p>

<p>Our regiment now moved back and to the right some
three-quarters of a mile, where we were supplied with
ammunition, and the men were allowed to make themselves
a cup of coffee and eat a "hardtack." I was faint
for want of food, for I had only a cup of coffee in the
early morning, and was favored with a hardtack by one
of the men, who were always ready and willing to share
their rations with us. We now learned that our brigade
had borne the brunt of a long and persistent effort by Lee
to break our line at this point, and that we were actually
the third line which had been thrown into this breach,
the other two having been wiped out before we advanced;
that as a matter of fact our brigade, being composed
so largely of raw troops&mdash;our regiment being really
more than half the brigade in actual number&mdash;was designed
to be held in reserve. But the onslaught of the
enemy had been so terrific, that by eight o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
our reserve line was all there was left and we had to be
sent in. The other three regiments were veterans, old and
tried. They had an established reputation of having never
once been forced back or whipped, but the One Hundred
and Thirty-second was new and, except as to numbers,
an unknown quantity. We had been unmercifully guyed
during the two preceding weeks, as I have said before, as
a lot of "greenhorns," "pretty boys" in "pretty new
clothes," "mamma's darlings," etc., etc., to the end of
the vets' slang calendar. Now that we had proved our
metal under fire, the atmosphere was completely changed.
Not the semblance of another jibe against the One Hundred
and Thirty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>

<p>We did not know how well we had done, only that we
had tried to do our duty under trying circumstances, until
officers and men from other regiments came flocking over
to congratulate and praise us. I didn't even know we
had passed through the fire of a great battle until the
colonel of the Fourteenth Indiana came over to condole
with us on the loss of Colonel Oakford, and incidentally
told us that this was undoubtedly the greatest battle of
the war thus far, and that we probably would never have
such another.</p>

<p>After getting into our new position, I at once began
to look up our losses. I learned that Colonel Oakford
was killed by one of the rebel sharp-shooters just as the
regiment scaled the fence in its advance up the knoll,
and before we had fired a shot. It must have occurred
almost instantly after I left him with orders for the left
of the line. I was probably the last to whom he spoke.
He was hit by a minie-ball in the left shoulder, just
below the collar-bone. The doctor said the ball had
severed one of the large arteries, and he died in a very
few minutes. He had been in command of the regiment
a little more than a month, but during that brief time his
work as a disciplinarian and drill-master had made it
possible for us to acquit ourselves as creditably as they
all said we had done. General Kimball was loud in our
praise and greatly lamented Colonel Oakford's death,
whom he admired very much. He was a brave, able,
and accomplished officer and gentleman, and his loss to
the regiment was irreparable.</p>

<p>Had Colonel Oakford lived his record must have been
brilliant and his promotion rapid, for very few volunteer
officers had so quickly mastered the details of military
tactics and routine. He was a thorough disciplinarian,
an able tactician, and the interests and welfare of his
men were constantly upon his heart.</p>

<p>My diary records the fact that I saw Captain Willard,
of the Fourteenth Connecticut, fall as we passed their
line on our way to the rear; that he appeared to have
been hit by a grape-shot or piece of shell. I did not
know him, only heard that he was a brother of E. N.
Willard, of Scranton. The Fourteenth Connecticut men
said he was a fine man and splendid officer.</p>

<p>Among the wounded&mdash;reported mortally&mdash;was Sergeant
Martin Hower, of Company K, one of our very
best non-commissioned officers. I saw him at the hospital,
and it was very hard to be able to do nothing for him.
It seemed our loss must reach upward of two hundred
killed, wounded and missing. Out of seven hundred
and ninety-eight who answered to roll-call in the morning,
we had with us less than three hundred at the close of the
fight. Our actual loss was: Killed&mdash;Officers, two (Colonel
Oakford and Lieutenant Cranmer); men, twenty-eight;
total, thirty. Wounded&mdash;Officers, four; men, one
hundred and ten; total, one hundred and forty-four. To
this should be added at least thirty of the men who died
of their wounds within the next few days, which would
make our death loss in this battle upward of sixty. Of
the missing, many of them were of those who joined the
Irish brigade in their charge, and who did not find us
again for a day or so. It may seem strange that a man
should not be able to find his regiment for so long a time,
when really it is so close at hand. But when one remembers
that our army of about seventy-five thousand men
had upward of two hundred regiments massed within say
two square miles, and that they were constantly changing
position, it will be seen that looking for any one regiment
is almost like looking for a needle in a hay-mow.</p>

<hr class="single" />

<p class="c smcap">THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM&mdash;CONTINUED</p>


<p>D<span class="smcap">uring</span> the afternoon of this day we were again moved
further to the right and placed as supports of a battery.
We were posted about two hundred yards directly in
front of the guns on low ground. The battery was evidently
engaged in another artillery duel. We were in a
comparatively safe position, so long as the rebel guns
directed their firing at our battery; but after a time they
began "feeling for the supports," first dropping their
shells beyond our guns, then in front of them, until they
finally got a pretty good range on our line and filled the
air with bursting shells over our heads. One and another
was carried to the rear, wounded, and the line became very
restive. We were required to lie perfectly quiet. We
found this very much more trying than being at work,
and the line began to show symptoms of wavering, when
General Kimball, who with his staff had dismounted and
was resting near us, immediately mounted his horse and,
riding up and down the line, shouted: "Stand firm, trust
in God, and do your duty."</p>

<p>It was an exceedingly brave act, and its effect was
electric upon the men. There was no more wavering, and
the rebel battery, evidently thinking they had not found
the "supports," soon ceased firing upon us. It was now
near night and the firing very perceptibly slackened in our
vicinity, though a mile or more to the left it still continued
very heavy. This, we afterwards learned, was the work
at what has passed into history as "Burnside's" bridge&mdash;the
effort of Burnside's corps to capture the stone bridge
over Antietam creek, near the village of Sharpsburg, and
the heights beyond. These were gallantly carried after a
terrific fight quite late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Our work, so far as this battle was concerned, was done.
We rested "on our arms" where we were for the next
forty-eight hours, expecting all the next day a renewal
of the fighting; but nothing was done in our neighborhood
beyond a few shots from the battery we were supporting.
On the second day it became known that Lee
had hauled off, and there was no immediate prospect of
further fighting. Our companies were permitted to gather
up their dead, and burying parties were organized.</p>

<p>We were allowed to go over the field freely. It was
a gruesome sight. Our own dead had been cared for, but
the rebel dead remained as they had fallen. In the hot
sun the bodies had swollen and turned black. Nearly all
lay with faces up and eyes wide open, presenting a spectacle
to make one shudder. The distended nostrils and
thickened lips made them look like negroes, except for
their straight hair. Their limbs and bodies were so enlarged
that their clothing seemed ready to burst. Some
ghouls had been among them, whether from their own
lines or from ours, could not be known, but every man's
pockets had been ripped out and the contents taken.</p>

<p>In company with Captain Archbald I went over the
position occupied by our regiment and brigade, the
famous "sunken road,"&mdash;that is, the lane or road extending
from near the "Roulette house" towards Sharpsburg.
For some distance it had been cut through the opposite
side of the knoll upon which we fought, and had the appearance
of a sunken road. It was literally filled with
rebel dead, which in some places lay three and four bodies
deep. We afterwards saw pictures of this road in the
illustrated papers, which partially portrayed the horrible
scene. Those poor fellows were the Fifth<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-C" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote C.">[C]</a> Georgia
regiment. This terrible work was mostly that of our
regiment, and bore testimony to the effectiveness of the
fire of our men.</p>

<p>The position was an alluring one: the road was cut
into the hill about waist high, and seemed to offer secure
protection to a line of infantry, and so no doubt this line
was posted there to hold the knoll and this Sharpsburg
road. It proved, however, nothing but a death-trap, for
once our line got into position on the top of this crescent-shaped
ridge we could reach them by a direct fire on the
centre and a double flanking fire at the right and left of
the line, and only about one hundred yards away. With
nothing but an open field behind them there was absolutely
no escape, nothing but death or surrender, and they
evidently chose the former, for we saw no white flag displayed.
We could now understand the remark of their
lieutenant-colonel, whom our boys brought in, as already
mentioned: "You have killed all my poor boys. They
lie there in the road." I learned later that the few survivors
of this regiment were sent South to guard rebel
prisoners.</p>

The dead are probably from the Sixth Georgia Confederate troops<br /><a href="images/gs10.png">(see image enlarged)</a></span>
</div>

<p>The lines of battle of both armies were not only marked
by the presence of the dead, but by a vast variety of army
equipage, such as blankets, canteens, haversacks, guns,
gun-slings, bayonets, ramrods, some whole, others broken,&mdash;verily,
a besom of destruction had done its work faithfully
here. Dead horses were everywhere, and the stench
from them and the human dead was horrible. "Uncle"
Billy Sherman has said, "War is hell!" yet this definition,
with all that imagination can picture, fails to reveal all its
bloody horrors.</p>

<p>The positions of some of the dead were very striking.
One poor fellow lay face down on a partially fallen stone
wall, with one arm and one foot extended, as if in the act
of crawling over. His position attracted our attention,
and we found his body literally riddled with bullets&mdash;there
must have been hundreds&mdash;and most of them shot into
him after he was dead, for they showed no marks of
blood. Probably the poor fellow had been wounded in
trying to reach shelter behind that wall, was spotted
in the act by our men, and killed right there, and became
thereafter a target for every new man that saw him.
Another man lay, still clasping his musket, which he was
evidently in the act of loading when a bullet pierced his
heart, literally flooding his gun with his life's blood, a
ghastly testimonial to his heroic sacrifice.</p>

<p>We witnessed the burying details gathering up and
burying the dead. The work was rough and heartless,
but only comporting with the character of war. The natural
reverence for the dead was wholly absent. The poor
bodies, all of them heroes in their death, even though in
a mistaken cause, were "planted" with as little feeling as
though they had been so many logs. A trench was dug,
where the digging was easiest, about seven feet wide and
long enough to accommodate all the bodies gathered
within a certain radius; these were then placed side by
side, cross-wise of the trench, and buried without anything
to keep the earth from them. In the case of the
Union dead the trenches were usually two or three feet
deep, and the bodies were wrapped in blankets before
being covered, but with the rebels no blankets were used,
and the trenches were sometimes so shallow as to leave
the toes exposed after a shower.</p>

<p>No ceremony whatever attended this gruesome service,
but it was generally accompanied by ribald jokes, at the
expense of the poor "Johnny" they were "planting."
This was not the fruit of debased natures or degenerate
hearts on the part of the boys, who well knew it might be
their turn next, under the fortunes of war, to be buried
in like manner, but it was recklessness and thoughtlessness,
born of the hardening influences of war.</p>

<p>Having now given some account of the scenes in which
I participated during the battle and the day after, let us
look at another feature of the battle, and probably the
most heart-breaking of all, the field hospital. There was
one established for our division some three hundred yards
in our rear, under the shelter of a hill. Here were gathered
as rapidly as possible the wounded, and a corps of
surgeons were busily engaged in amputating limbs and
dressing wounds. It should be understood that the accommodations
were of the rudest character. A hospital
tent had been hurriedly erected and an old house and barn
utilized. Of course, I saw nothing of it or its work until
the evening after the battle, when I went to see the body
of our dead colonel and some of our Scranton boys who
were wounded. Outside the hospital were piles of amputated
arms, legs, and feet, thrown out with as little care
as so many pieces of wood. There were also many dead
soldiers&mdash;those who had died after reaching the hospital&mdash;lying
outside, there being inside scant room only for the
living. Here, on bunches of hay and straw, the poor
fellows were lying so thickly that there was scarce room
for the surgeon and attendants to move about among
them. Others were not allowed inside, except officers and
an occasional friend who might be helping. Our chaplain
spent his time here and did yeoman service helping the
wounded. Yet all that could be done with the limited
means at hand seemed only to accentuate the appalling
need. The pallid, appealing faces were patient with a
heroism born only of the truest metal. I was told by
the surgeons that such expressions as this were not infrequent
as they approached a man in his "turn": "Please,
doctor, attend to this poor fellow next; he's worse than
I," and this when his own life's blood was fast oozing
away.</p>

<p>Most of the wounded had to wait hours before having
their wounds dressed, owing to insufficient force and inadequate
facilities. I was told that not a surgeon had his
eyes closed for three days after this battle. The doctors
of neighboring towns within reach came and voluntarily
gave their services, yet it is doubtless true that hundreds
of the wounded perished for want of prompt and proper
care. This is one of the unavoidable incidents of a great
battle&mdash;a part of the horrors of war. The rebel wounded
necessarily were second to our own in receiving care from
the surgeons, yet they, too, received all the attention that
was possible under the circumstances. Some of their surgeons
remained with their wounded, and I am told they
and our own surgeons worked together most energetically
and heroically in their efforts to relieve the sufferings of
all, whether they wore the blue or the gray. Suffering,
it has been said, makes all the world akin. So here, in
our lines, the wounded rebel was lost sight of in the suffering
brother.</p>

<p>We remained on the battle-field until September 21,
four days after the fight.</p>

<p>My notes of this day say that I was feeling so miserable
as to be scarcely able to crawl about, yet was
obliged to remain on duty; that Lieutenant-Colonel Wilcox,
now in command, and Major Shreve were in the
same condition. This was due to the nervous strain
through which we had passed, and to insufficient and unwholesome
food. As stated before, we had been obliged
to eat whatever we could get, which for the past four
days had been mostly green field corn roasted as best we
could. The wonder is that we were not utterly prostrated.
Nevertheless, I not only performed all my duties,
but went a mile down the Antietam creek, took a bath,
and washed my underclothing, my first experience in the
laundry business.</p>

<p>We had been now for two weeks and more steadily on
the march, our baggage in wagons somewhere en route,
without the possibility of a change of clothing or of
having any washing done. Most of this time marching
in a cloud of dust so thick that one could almost cut it,
and perspiring freely, one can imagine our condition.
Bathing as frequently as opportunity offered, yet our
condition was almost unendurable. For with the accumulation
of dirt upon our body, there was added the ever-present
scourge of the army, body lice. These vermin,
called by the boys "graybacks," were nearly the size of a
grain of wheat, and derived their name from their bluish-gray
color. They seemed to infest the ground wherever
there had been a bivouac of the rebels, and following
them as we had, during all of this campaign, sleeping
frequently on the ground just vacated by them, no one
was exempt from this plague. They secreted themselves
in the seams of the clothing and in the armpits chiefly. A
good bath, with a change of underclothing, would usually
rid one of them, but only to acquire a new crop in the
first camp. The clothing could be freed of them by boiling
in salt water or by going carefully over the seams
and picking them off. The latter operation was a frequent
occupation with the men on any day which was
warm enough to permit them to disrobe for the purpose.
One of the most laughable sights I ever beheld was the
whole brigade, halted for a couple of hours' rest one hot
day, with clothing off, "skirmishing," as the boys called
it, for "graybacks." This was one of the many unpoetical
features of army life which accentuated the sacrifices
one made to serve his country.</p>

<p>How did we ordinarily get our laundrying done? The
enlisted men as a rule always did it themselves. Occasionally
in camp a number of them would club together
and hire some "camp follower" or some other soldier to
do it. Officers of sufficient rank to have a servant, of
course, readily solved the question. Those of us of lesser
rank could generally hire it done, except on the march.
Then we had to be our own laundrymen. Having, as in
the above instance, no change of clothing at hand, the
washing followed a bath, and consisted in standing in the
running water and rubbing as much of the dirt out of
the underwear as could be done without soap, for that
could not be had for love or money; then hanging them
on the limb of a tree and sitting in the sun, as comfortable
as possible, whilst wind and sun did the drying. A
"snap-shot" of such a scene would no doubt be interesting.
But "snap-shots" unfortunately were not then in
vogue, and so a picture of high art must perish. We
could not be over particular about having our clothes dry.
The finishing touches were added as we wore them back
to camp.</p>

<p>My diary notes that there were nine hundred and
ninety-eight rebel dead gathered and buried from in front
of the lines of our division. This line was about a quarter
of a mile long, and this was mostly our work (our division),
although Richardson's division had occupied part
of this ground before us, but had been so quickly broken
that they had not made much impression upon the enemy.
Our division had engaged them continuously and under
a terrific fire from eight o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> until 12.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> It
may be asked why during that length of time and under
such a fire all were not annihilated. The answer is, that
inaccuracy and unsteadiness in firing on both sides greatly
reduce its effectiveness, and taking all possible advantage
of shelter by lying prone upon the ground also prevents
losses; but the above number of rebel dead, it
should be remembered, represents, probably, not more
than twenty to twenty-five per cent. of their casualties in
that area of their lines; the balance were wounded and
were removed. So that with nine hundred and ninety-eight
dead it can be safely estimated that their losses exceeded
four thousand killed and wounded in that area.
This would indicate what was undoubtedly true, that we
were in the very heart of that great battle.</p>

<p>Here I wish to say that some chroniclers of battles have
undertaken to measure the effectiveness and bravery of the
different regiments, batteries, etc., by the numbers they
have lost in certain battles; for example, one historian
has made a book grading the regiments by the number of
men they lost in action, assuming that the more men killed
and wounded, the more brilliant and brave had been its
work. This assumption is absolutely fallacious. Heavy
losses may be the result of great bravery with splendid
work. On the other hand, they may be the result of cowardice
or inefficiency. Suppose, under trying circumstances,
officers lose their heads and fail to properly
handle their men, or if the latter prove cowardly and
incapable of being moved with promptness to meet the
exigency, great loss usually ensues, and this would be
chargeable to cowardice or inefficiency. According to the
loss way of estimating fighting regiments, the least deserving
are liable to be credited with the best work. The
rule is, the better drilled, disciplined, and the better officered,
the less the losses in any position on the firing-line.</p>

<p>One regiment I have in mind, with which we were
afterwards brigaded, illustrates this principle. It was the
First Delaware Volunteer infantry. It was a three years'
regiment and had been in the field more than a year when
we joined them. All things considered, it was the best
drilled and disciplined regiment I saw in the service. It
was as steady under fire as on parade. Every movement
in the tactics it could execute on the jump, and its fire
was something to keep away from. The result was that,
pushed everywhere to the front because of its splendid
work, it lost comparatively few men. Every man was a
marksman and understood how to take all possible advantage
of the situation to make his work most effective and
at the same time take care of himself. This regiment,
whose record was one unbroken succession of splendid
achievements during its whole period of service, might
never have gotten on a roll of fame founded on numbers
of men lost. How much more glorious is a record
founded on effective work and men saved!</p>

EXPEDITIONS</p>


<p>N<span class="smcap">either</span> side seemed anxious to resume the fighting on
the 18th, though there was picket firing and some cannonading.
We remained the next day where the darkness
found us after the battle, ready and momentarily expecting
to resume the work. All sorts of rumors were afloat
as to the results of the battle, also as to future movements.
Whether we had won a great victory and were to press
immediately forward to reap the fullest benefit of it, or
whether it was practically a drawn battle, with the possibilities
of an early retreat, we did not then know. We
had no idea of what the name of the battle would be. My
diary calls it the battle of "Meyer's Spring," from that
magnificent fountain, on our line of battle, described in
the last chapter. The Confederates named it the battle of
Sharpsburg, from the village of that name on the right
of their line. Two days later, after the rebels had hauled
off&mdash;which they did very leisurely the next day and night&mdash;we
received "Little Mac's" congratulatory order on the
great victory achieved at "Antietam."</p>

<p>So far as our part of the battle was concerned, we knew
we had the best of it. We had cleaned up everything in
our front, and the "chip was still serenely resting on our
shoulder." But what had been the outcome elsewhere on
the line we did not know. That our army had been terrifically
battered was certain. Our own losses indicated this.
We were therefore both relieved and rejoiced on receiving
the congratulatory order. I confess to have had some
doubts about the extent of the victory, and whether, had
Lee remained and shown fight, we would not have repeated
the old story and "retired in good order." As it
was, the tide had evidently turned, and the magnificent old
Army of the Potomac, after so many drubbings, had been
able to score its first decisive victory.</p>

<p>On the twenty-second day of September we were again
on the march, our regiment reduced in numbers, from
casualties in the battle and from sickness, by nearly three
hundred men. Lieutenant-Colonel Wilcox was now in
command. The body of our late colonel had been shipped
to Scranton under guard of Privates S. P. Snyder and
Charles A. Meylert, Company K, the "exigencies of the
service" permitting of no larger detail nor any officer to
accompany it.</p>

<p>We were told the army was bound for Harper's Ferry,
distant some eight to ten miles. We passed through the
village of Sharpsburg&mdash;what there was left of it. It had
been occupied by the rebels as the extreme right of their
line on the morning of the battle. It presented abundant
evidence of having been well in the zone of the fight. Its
buildings were riddled with shells, and confusion seemed
to reign supreme. We learned that Burnside, with the
left wing of the army, had a very hot argument with Lee's
right during the afternoon for the possession of the stone
bridge over Antietam creek at the foot of the hill entering
the village; that after two repulses with heavy loss, Colonel
Hartranft (afterwards Governor of Pennsylvania) led
his regiment, the Fifty-first Pennsylvania Volunteers and
the Fifty-first New York, in a magnificent charge and carried
the bridge and the heights above, and Sharpsburg was
ours. If any one would like to get an idea of what terrific
work that charge was they should examine that bridge and
the heights on the Sharpsburg side. The latter rise almost
perpendicularly more than three hundred feet. One of
the "boys" who went over that bridge and up those
heights in that memorable charge was Private Edward
L. Buck, Fifty-first Pennsylvania Volunteers, formerly
Assistant Postmaster of Scranton, and ever since the war
a prominent citizen of this city. That bridge is now
known as "Burnside's Bridge." Forty-one years afterwards,
I passed over it, and was shown a shell still sticking
in the masonry of one of the arches. It was a conical
shell probably ten inches long, about half of it left protruding.</p>

<p>Little of special interest occurred on this march until
we reached the Potomac, a short distance above Harper's
Ferry. Here we were shown the little round house where
John Brown concealed his guns and "pikes" prior to his
famous raid three years before. This was his rendezvous
on the night before his ill-starred expedition descended
upon the State of Virginia and the South, in an insane
effort to free the slaves. Our division was headed by
the Fourteenth Connecticut, and as we approached the
river opposite Harper's Ferry its fine band struck up the
then new and popular air, "John Brown's Body," and
the whole division took up the song, and we forded the
river singing it. Slavery had destroyed the Kansas home
of old John Brown, had murdered his sons, and undoubtedly
driven him insane, because of his anti-slavery
zeal. The great State of Virginia&mdash;the "Mother of
Presidents"&mdash;had vindicated her loyalty to the "peculiar
institution," and, let it be added, her own spotless
chivalry, by hanging this poor, crazy fanatic for high
treason! Was there poetic justice in our marching into
the territory where these events transpired singing:</p>

<p class="poem">
"John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the grave,<br />
His soul goes marching on?"</p>

<p>This couplet,</p>

<p class="poem">"We'll hang Jeff Davis to a sour apple-tree,"</p>

<p>was sung with peculiar zest, though I never quite understood
what the poet had against the sour apple-tree.</p>

<p>We marched through the quaint old town of Harper's
Ferry, whose principal industry had been the government
arsenal for the manufacture of muskets and other army
ordnance. These buildings were now a mass of ruins, and
the remainder of the town presented the appearance of a
plucked goose, as both armies had successively captured
and occupied it. We went into camp on a high plateau
back of the village known as Bolivar Heights. The
scenic situation at Harper's Ferry is remarkably grand.
The town is situated on the tongue or fork of land at the
junction of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers. From
the point where the rivers join, the land rises rapidly until
the summit of Bolivar Heights is reached, several hundred
feet above the town, from which a view is had of
one of the most lovely valleys to be found anywhere in
the world&mdash;the Shenandoah Valley. Across the Potomac
to the east and facing Harper's Ferry rises Maryland
Heights, a bluff probably a thousand feet high, while
across the Shenandoah to the right towers another precipitous
bluff of about equal height called Loudon Heights.
Both of these bluffs commanded Bolivar Heights and Harper's
Ferry.</p>

<p>It was the sudden and unexpected appearance of Stonewall
Jackson's batteries upon both of these supposed inaccessible
bluffs that ten days before had forced the surrender
of the garrison of ten thousand Union troops which
had been posted here to hold Harper's Ferry. It was said
that the rain of shot and shell from those bluffs down
upon our forces was simply merciless, and Jackson had
cut off all avenues of escape before opening his batteries.
The cavalry, I believe, cut their way out, but the infantry,
after twenty-four hours of that storm of shot and shell,
were forced to hoist the white flag. How they could have
lived half that time in such a hell of fire is a marvel.
Everything above ground bore evidence of this fire.
There were unexploded shells lying about in great numbers.</p>

<p>An incident that might have been anything but funny
occurred the day after we encamped here. A new regiment
joined the army and marched past our division to a
point farther up the heights and went into camp. They
were a fine-looking regiment, full in numbers, and with
new, clean uniforms. Their reception at the hands of the
"vets" was very like our own three weeks before. Our
boys, however, were "vets" now, and joined in the "reception"
with a zest quite usual under such circumstances.
However, the "tenderfeet" incident had passed, and we
were preparing our evening meal, when bang! bang!
bang! bang! rang out a half-dozen shots in quick succession.
Every man jumped as though the whole rebel
army was upon us. It was soon discovered that the explosions
came from the camp of the "tenderfeet." Some of
those greenhorns had gathered a number of those unexploded
shells, set them up on end for a fireplace, and were
quietly boiling their coffee over them when they, of
course, exploded. Why none of them were seriously
injured was a miracle. At the moment of explosion no
one happened to be very near the fire. A moment before
a dozen men had been standing over it. Does Providence
graciously look out for the tenderfoot? Some of them,
I fear, were made to feel that they would rather be dead
than take the guying they got for this evidence of their
verdancy.</p>

<p>Camp life at Bolivar Heights soon resolved itself into
the usual routine of drill and picket duty. How many
corps of the army were encamped here I did not know,
but we were a vast city of soldiers, and there was no end
of matters to occupy attention when off duty. These included
bathing expeditions to the Shenandoah, a mile and
a half away; the "doing" of the quaint old town of
Harper's Ferry, and rambles up Maryland and Loudon
Heights, both of which were now occupied by our troops.
This was our first experience in a large encampment in
the field. One feature of it was exceedingly beautiful,
and that was its system of "calls." The cavalry and
artillery were encamped on one side of us. Each
battery of artillery and battalion of cavalry had its
corps of "trumpeters" or "buglers," while the infantry
regiments had their drum corps, whose duty it
was to sound the various "camp calls." The principal
calls were "reveille," the getting up or morning
roll-call, at sunrise usually; the guard mount, the
drill, the meal calls, the "retreat" (evening roll-call),
and the "taps," the "turning in" or "lights out" call.
The reveille, the retreat, and taps were required to be
sounded by each battery, troop, and regiment in consecutive
order, commencing at the extreme right. The firing
of the morning gun was the signal for the first corps of
cavalry buglers to begin the reveille, then in succession it
was repeated first through the bugler corps and then by
the drum corps back and forth through the lines until it
had gone through the whole army. As a martial and
musical feature it was exceedingly beautiful and inspiring.
But as its purpose was to hustle out sleepy men to roll-call,
it is doubtful if these features were fully appreciated;
that its advent was an occasion for imprecation rather
than appreciation the following story may illustrate.</p>

<p>A group of "vets" were discussing what they would do
when they got home from the war. Several plans had
been suggested&mdash;the taking into permanent camp of the
soldier's sweetheart being the chief goal, of course. When
Pat's turn came to tell what he was going to do, he said:</p>

<p>"I'll be takin' me girl and settling down wid her
housekeepin' and thin i'll be hirin' of a dhrum corps to
come an' play the ravalye iviry mornin' under me chamber
windi."</p>

<p>"What will you do that for? Haven't you had enough
of the reveille here?"</p>

<p>"I'll just h'ist me windi, an' I'll yell, 'To h&mdash;l wid yer
ravalye; I'll slape as long as I plase.'"</p>

<p>Many of these "calls" were parodied by the men. Here
is the reveille:</p>

<p class="poem">I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,<br />
I can't get 'em up at all, sir;<br />
I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up,<br />
I can't get 'em up at all.<br />
I'll go and tell the captain,<br />
I'll go and tell the captain,<br />
I'll go and tell the captain,<br />
I can't get 'em up at all.</p>

<p>This is the sick call:</p>

<p class="poem">Get your quinine, get your quinine,<br />
And a blue pill too, and a blue pill too.<br />
Get your quinine.</p>

<p>And so on down the list. The retreat call at sundown
was really enjoyed and was made more of. The day's
work was then over, and each corps elaborated its music,
the bands frequently extending it into an evening concert.</p>

<p>The almost universal time-killer was cards. Of course
various games were played, but "poker" was king. A
game of the latter could be found in almost every company
street, officers as well as men took a "twist at the
tiger." At the battle of Chancellorsville I saw a game in
full blast right under fire of the rebel shells. Every
screeching shell was greeted with an imprecation, while
the game went on just the same.</p>

<p>After our return home I was told of one man who made
enough money at cards to successfully start himself in
business. It was said he performed picket duty by hired
proxies during the following winter in camp at Falmouth,
and gave his time wholly to the game. A New York City
regiment lay adjoining our camp that winter, and a truer
lot of sports, from colonel down, never entered the service.
These men, officers and all, were his patrons. They
came to "do the Pennsylvania novice," but were themselves
done in the end.</p>

<p>On the 3d of October our brigade made what was
termed a reconnoissance in force out through Loudon
County, Virginia, to Leesburg. It was reported that
Jeb. Stuart was there with a force of cavalry and infantry.
General Kimball was sent with our brigade to capture
him if possible. Our orders on the evening of
October 2 were to report at brigade head-quarters at
seven o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, with three days' rations and sixty
rounds of ammunition. This meant "business," and was
a welcome change from the monotony of camp life. A
regiment of cavalry and two batteries of artillery had
been added to our brigade for this expedition. The
morning dawned bright and beautiful, but the day proved
a very hot one, and the first three or four miles of our
march was around the base of Loudon Heights, close
under the mountain over a very rocky road, and where
there was not a breath of air stirring. We were delayed
by the artillery in getting over this portion of the route,
and then we were marched almost on the run to make up
for the lost time. General Kimball had gone forward with
the cavalry, leaving his adjutant-general to bring up the
balance of the column as rapidly as possible. In his
efforts to hurry the men forward the latter overdid the
matter. The result was the men dropped in scores utterly
exhausted, so that within three hours our number
had been reduced more than half, and at the end of the
march in the evening there were just twenty-five officers
and men of our regiment present for duty, and of the
whole infantry force, three thousand strong at the start,
there were less than two hundred present at the finish.
This was due to an utter lack of judgment in marching.</p>

<p>The distance covered had been twenty-three miles. The
day had been hot, the road rough, and the men, in heavy
marching order with three days' rations and sixty rounds
of ammunition, had carried upwards of ninety pounds
each. With such a load and under such conditions, to
expect men to march any distance at the hurried pace
required was criminal folly. It bore its natural fruit.
Our men were scattered on the route from Harper's Ferry
to Leesburg, a demoralized lot of stragglers. My diary
mentions this experience with much indignation and attributes
the folly to the effects of whiskey. Of course,
this was only a surmise.</p>

<p>General Kimball was not directly responsible for it. In
his anxiety to capture Jeb. Stuart he had pushed ahead
with the cavalry, and knew nothing of our condition until
the forlorn party came straggling into his bivouac in the
evening. He was very indignant, and said some words
that cannot be recorded here. He was chagrined to find
Stuart gone, but now was greatly relieved that such was
the fact. Otherwise, said he, we would have stood an
excellent chance for a journey south under rebel escort.</p>

<p>On our way out we passed through several small villages,
in none of which did we find evidence of decided
Union sentiment, except in Waterford. This was a prosperous-looking
town, and the people seemed hospitable,
and manifested their Union sentiments by furnishing us
fruit and water freely. Our cavalry caught four of Stuart's
men in a picture-gallery and marched them to the rear. I
had the good fortune to secure a loaf of nice bread and
a canteen of sweet milk. If any one wishes to know how
good bread and milk is, let him step into my shoes on that
weary night.</p>

<p>Conditions compelled us to remain at Leesburg that
night. We rested on our arms, fearing Stuart might get
an inkling of our plight and pounce upon us. My diary
says I was unable to sleep because of suffering from a
sprained knee and ankle, caused by my horse stumbling
and falling on me just at dusk.</p>

<p>The next morning we were off bright and early on the
back track for camp, but by another route, so as to avoid
being cut off by Stuart. We had started out bravely to
capture this wily rebel. Now we were in mortal danger
of being captured by him. A detail was made to go back
over the route we came and gather up the stragglers.
On our way back I was refused a canteen of water by
the "Missus" of one of the plantation dwellings; but on
riding around to the rear, where the slaves lived, old
"Aunt Lucy" supplied us freely with both milk and
water. This was a sample of the difference between the
aristocrat in the mansion and the slave in the hovel. The
latter were always very friendly and ready to help us
in every possible way, while as a rule we met with rebuff
at the hands of the former.</p>

<p>Here we came in contact for the first time with plantation
life under the institution of slavery. The main or
plantation house was usually situated a quarter-mile or
more back from the "pike." They were generally low,
flat, one-story mansions, built of stone, while further to
the rear, in the form of a square, were the wooden cabins
of the slaves, each plantation a village by itself. We
marched only about eight miles this day, and bivouacked
near the village of Hillsboro. This evening we officers
of the field and staff caught on to a great treat in the
way of stewed chicken and corn cake for supper at a
Union farmhouse, and thought ourselves very fortunate
to be able to engage a breakfast at the same place for next
morning. Alas for the uncertainties of war! We had
barely rolled ourselves in our blankets for the night when
a staff officer from General Kimball's head-quarters came
and in a low tone of voice ordered us to arouse our men
without the least noise and be off as quietly as possible;
that scouts had reported that Stuart was after us in hot
haste. We were off almost in a jiffy. The night was cool
and foggy. The former favored our rapid march, and
the latter hid us from the enemy, who succeeded in capturing
only a couple of men who fell out.</p>

<p>We reached camp at Harper's Ferry shortly after sunrise,
a thoroughly tired and battered crowd. The expedition
proved absolutely fruitless, and had barely escaped
being captured, owing to mismanagement. It was the
most trying bit of service of our whole experience. Some
of our men never recovered from the exhaustion of that
first day's march, and had to be discharged as permanently
disabled.</p>

<p>Shortly after this another expedition relieved the monotony
of camp life. General Hancock, commanding the
Second Division of our corps, had been sent to make a
reconnoissance in force towards Halltown, six to eight
miles up the Shenandoah Valley. He had gone in the
morning, and shortly after noon we had heard cannonading
in that direction, showing that he had found "business."
It was Hancock's reputation to make "business,"
if the "Johnnies" could be induced to tarry long enough
for him to reach them. However, the firing shortly
ceased, and the night set in with a terrific rain-storm.
I remember, as I rolled myself in my blanket prepared
for a good sleep in defiance of the rain, sympathizing
with those poor fellows out on that reconnoissance
in all this storm. My sympathy was premature.
Just then I heard an ominous scratch on my tent, and
the hand of an orderly was thrust through the flaps
with an order. In much trepidation I struck a light.
Sure I was of trouble, or an order would not have been
sent out at such a time. My fears were realized. It
directed our regiment to report at brigade head-quarters
in heavy marching order with all possible despatch. Here
was a "state of things." Was it ever so dark, and did
it ever rain harder? Not in my recollection. But that
order left no time for cogitations. Into boots, clothing,
and gum blanket, out to the colonel's tent with the order,
then with his orders to all the companies, the sounding of
the long roll, the forming line, and away to brigade head-quarters
in that inky blackness and drenching rain was
the work of less than fifteen minutes. General Kimball
complimented us as being the first regiment to report, and
we were honored with the head of the column which was
to support Hancock at Halltown. French's division had
been ordered out as supports, and Kimball's brigade had
the advance.</p>

<p>We marched rapidly up the valley of the Shenandoah,
now as black as Erebus. But soon the rain ceased, the
clouds broke away, and the stars appeared, completely
transforming the scene, and except for the mud and our
wet and uncomfortable condition it would have been an
enjoyable march. After going about six miles we were
directed into a woods to rest until morning. Inside the
woods it was inky dark again, and we made headway
with much difficulty. Men and horses stumbled and
floundered over fallen logs and through brush at imminent
peril of limbs, until a halt was made, and after details
for picket had been sent out we were allowed to rest until
daylight.</p>

<p>It was now about three o'clock. But to rest, soaking
wet, almost covered with mud, in a woods that had been
so drenched with rain that everything was like a soaked
sponge, that was the problem. No fires were allowed, for
no one knew how near the enemy might be. However,
the men were tired enough to sleep, most of them, even
under those conditions. I well remember the weary walking
and stamping to keep warm until the sunshine came
to our relief. But daylight revealed a condition of things
relative to our position that, had the enemy known, we
might again have been made an easy prey. Our details
for water, after going out some distance, as they supposed
in our rear, suddenly found themselves uncomfortably
near the enemy's outposts, and hurried back to
camp with the information. It was found that in the
darkness our picket line had actually gotten turned
around, so that our rear had been carefully guarded,
whilst our front was left wholly exposed. The denseness
of the woods and the darkness of the night had been our
salvation. We shortly learned that Hancock had accomplished
his purpose and was moving back to Harper's
Ferry. We followed leisurely, reaching the camp about
noon, thoroughly tired and bedraggled from the rain and
mud.</p>

<p class="c smcap">FROM HARPER'S FERRY TO FREDERICKSBURG</p>


<p>W<span class="smcap">e</span> remained on Bolivar Heights, at Harper's Ferry,
without further special incident until the 31st of October,
1862. In the mean time Lieutenant-Colonel Wilcox had
been promoted to colonel to fill the vacancy caused by the
death of Colonel Oakford at Antietam. Major Albright
had been promoted to lieutenant-colonel and the senior
captain, Shreve, Company A, had been made major.
Colonel Wilcox was on his back with a severe case of
typhoid fever, and Lieutenant-Colonel Albright had been
some ten days absent on sick leave, during which time
Major Shreve had been in command. Lieutenant-Colonel
Albright, hearing of the probable movement of the
army, rejoined us in time to take command as we bade
farewell to Harper's Ferry. To show how little a soldier
can know of what is before him, I note the fact that we
had just completed fixing up our quarters for cold weather
at Camp Bolivar. This involved considerable labor and
some expense. My diary records the fact that I had
put up a "California stove" in my tent. This, if I remember
rightly, was a cone-shaped sheet-iron affair,
which had a small sliding door and sat on the ground,
with a small pipe extending through the canvas roof
just under the ridge-pole to the rear. It cost, I think,
about four dollars, and required some skill in "setting
up," chiefly in fixing the pipe so that it would not tumble
about one's ears with every blast of wind that shook the
tent, and in windy weather would at least carry some of
the smoke outside. A special course of engineering was
almost needed to be able to properly handle those stoves.
A little too much fire, and you had to adopt Pat's remedy
when Biddy's temper got up&mdash;sit on the outside until it
cooled down. Too little was worse than none, for your
tent became a smoke-house. On the whole, they were
much like the goose the aforesaid Pat captured and
brought into camp, "a mighty unconvanient burr'd, a
little too big for one and not big enough for two."</p>

<p>This fixing up of quarters had been done in contemplation
of remaining here through the winter, and we had
taken our cue from like actions of our brigade officers,
who were supposed to know something about the movements
of the army. When we got orders on the 29th of
October to prepare for the march, I was assured by the
adjutant-general of our brigade that it was nothing more
than a day's reconnoissance, and that we were certainly
not going to move our quarters. He knew as much about
it as I did. Within an hour after this order another came
directing us to move in heavy marching order, with three
days' rations and sixty rounds of ammunition. And so
we moved out of Harper's Ferry on the 31st of October,
leaving our fixed-up quarters, with my four-dollar stove,
to Geary's division, which succeeded to our camp.</p>

<p>We crossed the Shenandoah on a pontoon bridge and
skirted the mountain under Loudon Heights over the same
route south that we had taken on our way in from the
Leesburg raid. We marched very leisurely, making during
the first four days only about twenty-five miles, to a
village bearing the serious (?) name of Snickersville.
Here we had the first evidence of the presence of the
enemy. We were hurried through this village and up
through the gap in the mountain called "Snicker's Gap"
to head off the rebels. We soon came on to their scouts
and pickets, who fled precipitately without firing a gun.
Part of our division halted on the top of the gap, while a
couple of regiments skirmished through the woods both
sides of the road down to the foot of the mountain on the
other side. The enemy had taken "French leave," and
so our men returned and our division bivouacked here for
the night.</p>

<p>We now learned that these giant armies were moving
south in parallel columns, the mountain separating them.
At every gap or pass in the mountain a bristling head
or a clinched fist, so to speak, of one would be thrust
through and the other would try to hit it. This was
our mission, as we double-quicked it through this gap.
When we got there the "fist" had been withdrawn,
and our work for the time was over. But our bivouac
here&mdash;how beautiful it was! The fields were clean and
green, with plenty of shade, for right in the gap were
some good farms. Then the cavalry had not cleaned
the country of everything eatable, as was usual, they being
always in the advance. There was milk and bread to be
had, and somehow&mdash;I never dared to inquire too closely
about it&mdash;some good mutton came into camp that night,
so that we had a splendid breakfast next morning. Some
fine honey was added to the bill of fare. The man who
brought in the latter claimed that a rebel hive of bees
attacked him whilst on picket duty, and he confiscated
the honey as a measure of retaliation.</p>

<p>But the special feature that makes that camp linger in
my memory was the extraordinary beauty of the scene
in the valley below us when the evening camp-fires were
lighted. We were on a sort of table-land two or three
hundred feet above the broad valley, which widened out
at this point and made a most charming landscape. As
the darkness drew on the camp-fires were lighted, and the
scene became one of weird, bewitching beauty. Almost
as far as the eye could reach, covering three and possibly
four square miles, were spread out the blazing camp-fires
of that mighty host of our "Boys in Blue." No drums
were beaten and the usual retreat call was not sounded,
but the thousands of camp-fires told of the presence of
our men. A martial city was cooking its evening coffee
and resting its weary limbs in the genial camp-fire glow,
whilst weary hearts were refreshed with the accompanying
chat about friends and dearer ones at home. The
scouting "Johnny Rebs" (and there were no doubt plenty
of them viewing the scene) could have gotten from it no
comforting information to impart as to our numbers.
Most of the Army of the Potomac, now largely augmented
by new regiments, was there, probably not less
than one hundred thousand men. It was a picture not of
a lifetime, but of the centuries. It made my blood leap
as I realized that I was looking down upon the grandest
army, all things considered, of any age or time. Its mission
was to save to liberty and freedom the life of the
best government the world ever saw. In its ranks was
the best blood of a free people. In intelligence it was far
superior to any other army that ever existed. Scholars
of all professions, tradesmen and farmers, were there,
fighting side by side, animated by the same patriotic impulse.
I said to myself, it is impossible that that army
should be beaten. It is the strong right arm of the Union,
and under God it shall assuredly deal the death-blow to
the rebellion. This it certainly did, though at a fearful
cost, for it was fighting the same blood. The inspiration
of that scene made me glad from the bottom of my heart
that I had the privilege of being just one in that glorious
army. After forty years, what would I take for that
association with all its dangers and hardships? What for
these pictures and memories? They are simply priceless.
I only wish I could so paint the pictures and reproduce
the scenes that they might be an inspiration to the same
patriotism that moved this mighty host.</p>

<p>One of our grizzly-headed "boys," after forty years,
tells the following story of his experiences on a foraging
expedition from the camp. Three of them started out
after beef. Some young steers had been seen in the distance.
They reached the field, a mile or more from
camp. They found the game a mighty vigorous lot of
young steers, and their troubles began when they tried to
corral any one of them. Both ends seemed to be in business
at the same time, whilst a tail-hold proved to have
more transportation possibilities than they had ever
dreamed of. Coaxing and persuasion proved utter failures,
for the bovines seemed to have the same prejudices
against our blue uniforms their owners had, and it would
not do to fire a gun. However, after two hours of the
hardest exercise they ever had, they succeeded in "pinching"
their steer with nose, horn, and tail-holds. Neither
of them had ever undertaken to butcher a beef before, and
a good-sized jackknife was all they had to work with.
But beef they came for and must have, and one was
selected to do the trick. Here again they counted without
their quarry. The latter evidently objected to being practised
on by novices, for as the knife entered his neck he
gave a jump which somehow nearly severed the would-be
butcher's thumb. Nevertheless, he completed his work
without a word, and the animal was skinned and divided.
Just as they had him down a field officer rode almost on
to them. They felt sure that their "fat was in the fire,"
for the officer&mdash;probably the field officer of the day&mdash;certainly
saw them and saw what they were doing. But
he turned and rode away without saying a word. It was
evidently one of those things he did not want to see. Well,
the fun was not yet over. They backed their beef to camp,
and this was about as uncomfortable a job as they ever
had. No more tired trio ever rolled themselves in
blankets than they were that night. But there was compensation.
They had an abundant supply of "fresh" on
hand and their sleep was sweet. Alas for the uncertainties
of camp life. Notwithstanding they took the
extra precaution to roll their several portions in their
coats and placed them under their heads for pillows, some
"sons of Belial" from an adjacent regiment who had discovered
them bringing their "game" into camp actually
stole every ounce of the beef out from under their too
soundly sleeping heads during the night and made off
with it. After all their labor and trouble neither of them
had a taste of that beef. Their nostrils were regaled
with the savory fumes of the cooking meat. They had
no difficulty in discovering where it was. Indeed, the
whelps who stole it rather paraded their steal, knowing
that the mouths of our men were sealed. They simply
could not say a word, for marauding was punishable with
death. The worst of the escapade was that the poor
fellow whose thumb had been so nearly severed was made
a cripple for life. He was never able to do another day's
duty, and to shield him the other two&mdash;be it said to their
everlasting honor&mdash;performed his picket duty in addition
to their own until he was discharged.</p>

<p>My diary notes the fact that Fitz-John Porter's corps
passed us just before night, and I saw its commander for
the first time. He was a small, slender, young-looking
man, with full black whiskers and keen black eyes. He
was dressed very modestly and wore the usual high black
slouch hat, with a much battered gold-tassel band. A pair
of silver stars on his shoulder, much obscured by wear
and dust, indicated his rank of major-general.</p>

<p>The next day, November 3, was cold and chilly and we
were early on the march, still southward. We had now
exhausted our supply of rations, and at a temporary halt
wagon-loads of hardtack and pork were driven along our
company lines and boxes of the bread and barrels of pork
dumped out, and the men told to fill their haversacks.
Barrel heads and boxes were soon smashed with the butts
of guns and contents appropriated, each man taking
all he would. Many a fine piece of the pork marched
away on a bayonet, ready for the noon-day meal. I
filled my own saddle-bags, as did the rest of us officers,
preferring to take no further chances on the grub
question.</p>

<p>We bivouacked about four o'clock, after a thirteen-mile
march in a raw and very chilly air. Just going into bivouac
I saw Major-General John F. Reynolds, who met
such a tragic death at Gettysburg the next July. His
corps&mdash;the First&mdash;was in the advance of ours. Our regiment
was marching at the head of our brigade column.
Lieutenant-Colonel Albright was temporarily absent and
I was directing the column. General Reynolds's corps
had passed into the field to the left and were already in
bivouac; the other troops of our division were not
visible at this point, and I was hesitating what direction
to give the column. General Reynolds was sitting on his
horse looking at us, evidently with much interest, and
noticing my dilemma, rode up to my assistance at once.
Addressing me as adjutant, he said: "Part of your corps
has moved in yonder," pointing out the place. "If I
were you I would go in here and occupy this field to the
right in column of divisions, and you may say General
Reynolds advised this, if you please." His manner and
way of doing this little service were so pleasant that he
captured me at once. Had he chosen to do so, he could
have given me orders, as the senior officer present, but
with a gentle courtesy he accomplished his purpose without
that, and to reassure me gave his name and rank in
this delicate way. I shall never forget his pleasant smile
as he returned my salute after thanking him for his suggestion.
He was a superb-looking man, dark complexioned,
wearing full black whiskers, and sat his fine horse
like a Centaur, tall, straight, and graceful, the ideal soldier.
I do not remember to have ever seen this remarkable
officer again. He was one of the few great commanders
developed by the war. A quiet, modest man,
he yet possessed a very decisive element of character, as
illustrated by the following incident related to me by my
friend Colonel W. L. Wilson, assistant adjutant-general
of one of the divisions of Reynolds's corps, and shows his
unwearied vigilance and his indefatigable capacity for
work. The corps was in the presence of the enemy, an
attack was deemed highly probable. Night had brought
on a storm of rain and intense darkness. General Reynolds
had given the proper officers very explicit instructions
about locating his picket lines, and Colonel Wilson,
knowing the critical nature of the work and his division
chief's anxiety over it, about midnight went out over
their part of the line to make doubly sure that everything
was right. Among the first persons he encountered after
reaching the outposts was General Reynolds, all alone,
making his way over the line in that drenching rain,
to be assured that the pickets were properly posted and
doing their duty. Here is Colonel Wilson's account of
the colloquy that ensued: "Who are you, sir? Where
do you belong? What are you doing here?" he volleyed
at me savagely. Being apparently reassured by
my reply, he continued in a less peremptory tone, "Who
ordered that line? How far out is it?" Receiving
my reply, he exclaimed, "Push it out, push it out
farther!" "How far, General?" I ventured to ask.
"Push it out until you feel something!" This was
Reynolds.</p>

<p>We continued our march down what I was told was
the valley of the Catochin. November 5 found us near
Upperville, where we bivouacked alongside an old graveyard,
our head-quarters being established inside the enclosure,
to get the protection of its stone wall from the
cold wind that was blowing. The temperature had fallen
during the past twenty-four hours, so that it was now
decidedly chilly&mdash;good for marching, but cold in bivouac.
My notes say that I was chilled through until my teeth
chattered; that I slept in the hollow made by a sunken
grave to get warm; that my dreams were not disturbed
by any unsubstantial hobgoblins of the defunct member
of an F. F. V. whose remains might have been resting
below me. The letters F. F. V. meant much in those war
days. They stood for "First Family of Virginia," an
expression much in use by her slave-proud aristocracy,
and, of course, much satirized by us of the North. On
this day we passed several very handsome mansions with
their slave contingents. One old "daddy" volunteered
the information that his "Mars was a pow'ful secesh;"
that he had three sons in the rebel army. My diary notes
with indignation that these rich plantations were carefully
guarded by our cavalry to prevent our soldiers entering
to get water as they passed. They would doubtless have
helped themselves to other things as well, especially things
eatable, but the owners were rebels and deserved to have
their property taken, we all felt.</p>

<p>The orders against marauding were punctuated by a
striking example this day. The cavalry orderly of the
general commanding our division, riding back to head-quarters
after delivering a batch of orders, among them
another on this hated subject, carried a pair of handsome
turkeys strapped to his saddle. It is safe to say that entire
flock came into our camp that night, and turkey was
served at breakfast to some of the rank and file as well as
to the general. Verily, "consistency thou art a jewel."</p>

<p>From Upperville we moved by easy marching down to
Warrenton. The weather had grown much colder. On
the 8th of November there was a fall of rain, succeeded
by snow, and we marched in a very disagreeable slush.
The bivouac in this snow was most trying. The result
for myself was a severe attack of fever and ague. I had
been much reduced in flesh from the fatigue and nervous
strain of the strenuous life of the past two months. This
attack prostrated me at once. I was placed in an ambulance,
being unable to ride my horse. The shaking and
jolting of that ambulance ride were something fearful. I
can now sympathize with the wounded who were compelled
to ride in those horrible vehicles. They were covered
wagons, with seats on each side, and made with
heavy, stiff springs, so as to stand the rough roads, which
were frequently cut through the fields. This night General
Kimball had me brought to his head-quarters, a brick
farm-house, for shelter. It was a kindness I greatly
appreciated. The next night our chaplain succeeded in
getting me into a farm-house some little distance from
the regiment. He secured this accommodation on the
strength of Freemasonry. The owner's name I have
preserved in my diary as Mr. D. L. F. Lake. He was one
of Mosby's "cavalry," as they called themselves. We in
our army called them "guerillas." They were the terror
of our army stragglers. They were "good Union men"
when our army was passing, but just as soon as the army
had passed they were in their saddles, picking up every
straggler and any who may have had to fall behind from
sickness. In that way they got quite a few prisoners.
This man did not hesitate to tell us the mode of their
operations. He said his farm had been literally stripped
of hay, grain, and cattle by our cavalry under General
Stoneman. All he had left was one chicken. This his
wife cooked for the chaplain and me. He brought out
Richmond papers during the evening and freely discussed
the issues of the war with the chaplain. I was too ill to
pay much attention to what was said, only to gather that
his idea of us Northern people was that we were a miserable
horde of invading barbarians, destined to be very
speedily beaten and driven out. He admitted, however,
that in financial transactions he preferred "greenbacks"
to the Confederate scrip, which I thought rather negatived
his boasted faith in the success of the Confederacy. His
wife, who had, not many years gone, been young and
pretty, occasionally chimed in with expressions of great
hate and bitterness. Perhaps the latter was not to be
wondered at from their stand-point, and they had just
now ample grounds for their bitter feelings in the fact
that they had just been relieved of all their portable property
by the Union forces. He had receipts for what
Stoneman had taken, which would be good for their market
value on his taking the oath of allegiance. But he
said he would die rather than take that oath, so he considered
his property gone. He no doubt thought better
of this later on, and probably got pay for his stuff. His
kindness to me on the score of our fraternal relations was
generous to the full extent of his ability, and showed him
to be a true man, notwithstanding his "secesh" proclivities.
It was a great favor, for had I been compelled to
remain out in that rough weather sick as I was, the consequences
must have been most serious. On leaving I tried
to pay him in gold coin for his hospitality, but he firmly
declined my money, saying: "You know you could not
have gotten into my house for money. Pay in like manner
as you have received when opportunity affords." For
this fraternal hospitality I shall always remember my
"secesh" Masonic brother with gratitude, for I feel that
it saved my life.</p>

<p>Another terrific day in that awful ambulance brought
me to Warrenton, where I got a room at a so-called hotel.
Here, upon the advice of our surgeon, I made application
for leave of absence on account of sickness. The red tape
that had to be "unwound" in getting this approved and
returned almost proved my ruin. Captain Archbald was
taken sick at this time, and his application for a like leave
accompanied mine. The corps surgeon, Dr. Dougherty,
called with our surgeon to examine us at the hotel, and
said he would approve both applications; that it would
be but a day or so before our leaves would be ready and
returned to us. The next day orders for the army to
move were issued, and we saw our men marching away.
It made my heart ache not to be in my place with them.
I was, however, barely able to sit up, so that was out
of the question. Now another possibility confronted us,
namely, being picked up and carried off as prisoners by
my late host's comrades, Mosby's guerillas. The army
was evidently evacuating Warrenton and vicinity, and
unless our leaves of absence reached us within a very few
hours we would be outside of the "Union lines" and
transportation to Washington unobtainable, for the railroad
trains did not pretend to run beyond the Union lines.
The next day came, the last of our troops were moving
out, and our leaves had not come. Captain Archbald and
I resolved that we must cut that "red tape" rather than
take the chances of going to Richmond. This we did by
securing suits of citizens' clothes and making our way as
citizens through the lines to Washington. From there
we had no difficulty in reaching home in uniform. At
Washington I wrote Colonel Albright of our dilemma
and the way we had solved it, and asked that our leaves
of absence be forwarded to us at Scranton. They came
some two weeks later. Had we remained at Warrenton,
they would never have reached us, unless in a rebel prison.
Yet I suppose we had committed an offence for which we
could have been court-martialled.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that just at the time I was
taken sick, on the 9th of November, whilst the army was
approaching Warrenton, the order relieving General McClellan
from the command of the Army of the Potomac
was issued. He was ordered to report to his home in
Trenton, N. J., on waiting orders. Great was the consternation
among the veterans of that army on his retirement,
for they really had a strong attachment for "Little
Mac," as they fondly called him. He took his leave in
an affectionate order, recounting the heroic deeds of this
noble army. This was followed by a grand review, accompanied
by battery salutes, and the military career of
General George B. McClellan passed into history.</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE FREDERICKSBURG CAMPAIGN</p>


<p>I <span class="smcap">must</span> pause long enough to speak of the days of
that sick leave. Just before reaching Scranton I met
on the train my old friend and employer, Joseph C. Platt,
of the Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Company, who insisted
on taking me home with him. As I had no home of my
own and no relations here, I accepted his kind hospitality.
Had I been their own son I could not have been cared
for more tenderly. Under the circumstances I am sure
I was not a very prepossessing object to entertain. I well
remember the warm bath and the glorious luxury of once
more being actually clean, dressed in a civilized night-robe,
and in a comfortable bed. It must be remembered
that a soldier must habitually sleep in his clothes. I had
not had my clothes off, except for a wash, since I entered
the army. I had evidently been living beyond my
strength, and now the latter gave way and I found myself
unable to leave my bed for the next two weeks. Dr.
William Frothingham gave me most excellent medical
treatment, and with the motherly nursing of Mrs. Platt
I was soon on the mend.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December I started back for my regiment.
I was by no means well, and the doctor was loath
to let me go, as were all my kind friends; but a grand
forward movement of the army was reported as in progress,
and I felt that I must be at my post. I reached
Washington on the 9th, and it took the next two days to
secure a pass and transportation to the front. The latter
was somewhat difficult to obtain, owing to the fact that
a movement of the army was in progress. What the character
of the movement was no one seemed to know, not
even the provost-marshal, who issued all passes.</p>

<p>I took a boat leaving at six o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on the 12th
for Aquia Creek and thence went by rail in a cattle-car
to its terminus in the open field opposite Fredericksburg.
(The rebels were mean enough to refuse us depot privileges
at the regular station in Fredericksburg.) I arrived
there about one o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> A brisk cannonade was in
progress between the Union batteries posted on the
heights back of Falmouth and the Confederate guns on
Marye's Heights, back of Fredericksburg. The problem
now was to find my regiment. A stranger standing near
said, in answer to my inquiry, that the Union army had
been encamped about a mile and a half back yonder,
pointing to the hills in our rear, but that he was quite
sure they had all gone across the river last night; that
a big fight had taken place about laying the pontoon
bridge over the river (the Rappahannock), and the
Union forces had beaten the rebels back, laid the bridge
and had crossed over and occupied the city. Fredericksburg
was a city of probably five or six thousand people,
lying on the west bank of the Rappahannock, which runs
at this point nearly southeast. The river is probably one
hundred and fifty to two hundred yards wide here, quite
deep, with a rather swift current and high banks, so that
one does not see the water until quite close to it. The
railroad formerly ran from Aquia Creek to Richmond
via Fredericksburg, the connection to Washington being
by boat from Aquia Creek. The war stopped its operation,
but so much of it as was in the Union lines had
been seized by the government, and was being operated
by the quartermaster's department for war purposes.
The stations of the latter were wherever the troops were,
and these were now operating against Fredericksburg,
hence I was dumped down in an open field opposite
that city as stated above. I was fortunate enough to
find a man who was going to Hancock's old camp,
and I concluded to go with him, believing that once
there I could find our division camp belonging to the
same corps.</p>

<p>I chartered a burly "contraban" to carry my luggage,
and we started. The ground was very soft from recent
rains, and the mud was something terrible. If one has
never encountered Virginia mud, he can have no adequate
idea of the meaning of the word. It gets a grip on your
feet and just won't let go. Every rise of your pedal
extremities requires a mighty tug, as if you were lifting
the earth, as indeed you are&mdash;a much larger share of it
than is comfortable.</p>

<p>A tramp of a mile and a half brought us to Hancock's
old camp. In my weak condition I was thoroughly exhausted,
and so my "contraban" claimed to be, for he
positively refused to go another step. I got my quartermaster
friend to take care of my baggage, whilst I continued
my search for our division camp. I was not successful
in finding it that night, and was obliged to accept
the invitation of a sick officer of the Eighty-first Pennsylvania
Volunteers to share his quarters for the night.
I had eaten breakfast at five o'clock that morning in
Washington and had eaten nothing since, and it was now
dusk. I was not only tired, but faint for want of food.
This officer, whose name I regret I have forgotten, was
a brother Mason, and kindly divided his meagre rations
with me, which consisted of boiled rice and hardtack.
He had a little molasses, with which the former was
lubricated, and a good strong cup of coffee was added.
It was not Waldorf-Astoria fare, to be sure, and the
explanation was that the boys had taken almost everything
eatable with them.</p>

<p>The next morning I picked up an old "crow-bait" of
a horse, the only four-footed transportation possibly obtainable,
and started for Fredericksburg to find my regiment.
The only directions I had about disposing of this
frame of a horse was to "turn the bones loose when you
get through with him." He could go only at a snail's
pace, and when I reached Fredericksburg it must have
been nine o'clock. I crossed the pontoon bridge, which
had been laid the morning before under circumstances
of the greatest gallantry by Howard's division of our
corps.</p>

<p>The "ball" was now well opened. Marye's Heights
(pronounced Marie, with the accent on the last letter, as
if spelled Maree), circling the city from the river above
to a point below the city, was literally crowded with batteries
of rebel artillery. These guns were firing at our
batteries on the heights on the other side of the river,
and also upon our troops occupying the city. The air
was filled with screeching, bursting shells, and a deafening
pandemonium was in progress. It was not a very inviting
place to enter under these circumstances, but it
was as safe for me as for my regiment, and my duty
was to be with them. The trouble was to find it in that
multitude of troops filling all the streets of the city.
Our corps alone numbered probably twelve thousand men
at that time, and the Ninth Corps was there besides.
However, I soon found Kimball's brigade to my great
delight, supposing our regiment was in it, as it was
when I went away. General Kimball greeted me with
great cordiality; but when I asked where my regiment
was, he said he was sorry he could not inform me; that
they had that morning been transferred, much against
his will, to General Max Weber's brigade, and where
that was he did not know. It was probably somewhere
in the city. Said he:</p>

<p>"You cannot possibly find it now, and it is a waste
of time to try. I can give you plenty of work to-day.
Stay with me and serve as an aide on my staff."</p>

<p>The officers of his staff, all of whom were personal
friends, urgently joined in the general's invitation. But
I felt that I must be with the regiment if it were possible
to find it, and so declined what would have been a distinguishing
service. Some distance down the main street
I ran on to the regiment just when I had abandoned all
hope of finding it. My reception was exceedingly cordial,
accompanied with the remark: "Just in time, adjutant,
just in time." I found Lieutenant-Colonel Albright
in command and with no help from our field and staff.
Colonel Wilcox was still on sick leave. Major Shreve
had returned to camp during the heavy cannonading of
the day before, and Colonel Albright had lost his voice
from a severe cold, so that I had to supply voice for
him in the issuing of orders, in addition to my other
duties.</p>

<p>The situation was most portentous. We lay in the
main street under the shelter of the houses, which were
being bombarded by the rebel batteries in their efforts
to reach our troops. The houses were all vacant; the
people had fled on the approach of our army. Not a
soul did we see of the inhabitants of the city during the
two days we occupied it. They had evidently left in
great haste, taking but few things with them. I was told
that in some houses the boys found and ate meals that
had been prepared and left in their flight, and in all
there was more or less food, which was appropriated.
Flour was plentiful, and the night after the battle there
were army flapjacks galore. In some cases it might have
been said these were fearfully and wonderfully made,
but they went just the same.</p>

<p>An incident connected with this occupation of Fredericksburg
comes to light after forty years. If General
Howard should see it the mystery of the sudden disappearance
of his breakfast on that morning might be
cleared up. Our regiment happened to be quartered
in the morning near his head-quarters. Rations were
scarce. General Howard's servant had prepared him a
most tempting breakfast from supplies found and confiscated
from one of the houses. The sight of this repast
and its savory fumes were too much for the empty
stomachs of two of our men, who shall be nameless
here. The trick was a neat one. One of them got the
attention of the cook and held it until the other reached
into the tent and dumped the contents of the main dish,
hot and steaming, into his haversack and quietly sauntered
away. When the cook discovered his loss the other
fellow was gone. These rascals said it was the best dish
of ham and eggs they ever ate. Many houses had fine
pianos and other musical instruments, and in some instances
impromptu dances were on whilst Confederate
shells whanged through the house above their heads. It
is safe to say that there was little left of valuable bric-à-brac
to greet the fugitive people on their return. And
it is highly probable that pianos and handsome furniture
needed considerable repairing after the exodus of the
"Yank." This was not due to pure vandalism, although
war creates the latter, but to the feeling of hatred for
the miserable rebels who had brought on the war and
were the cause of our being there. And it must be admitted
there were some who pocketed all they could for
the commercialism there might be in it, the argument
again being, "somebody will take it, and I might as well
have it as the other fellow." The first part of the argument
was doubtless as true as the latter part was false.
Many trinkets were hawked about among the men after
the fight as souvenirs. Among them was a silver-plated
communion flagon. Some scamp had filched it from one
of the churches and was trying to sell it. Fortunately, he
did not belong to our regiment. Our chaplain took it
from him and had it strapped to his saddle-bag. His
purpose was to preserve it for its owner if the time
should come that it could be returned. But in the meantime
its presence attached to his saddle made him the
butt of any amount of raillery from both officers and
men.</p>

<p>When I joined the regiment it was lying in front of the
Court-House, from the steeple of which some sixty or
seventy feet high, the flags of our signal-corps were most
actively wagging. It occurred to me that those signal-men
were mighty nervy fellows. They were a beautiful
mark for the rebel batteries, which were evidently doing
their best to knock them out. The steeple was a plain,
old-fashioned affair, having an open belfry, which seemed
to be supported by four upright posts or timbers. I saw
one of those uprights knocked out by a rebel shell. A
couple more equally good shots and our signal-fellows
would come ignominiously&mdash;no, gloriously&mdash;down, for
there could be no ignominy with such pluck. But the
wig-wagging went on, I fancied, with a little more snap
and audacity than before, and they maintained their station
there in the very teeth of the rebel batteries until the
army was withdrawn. So much for "Yankee nerve."
I afterwards learned that the signal-officer there was none
other than Lieutenant Frederick Fuller, of Scranton, one
of my most intimate personal friends. Lieutenant Fuller
told me that he was on duty at Burnside's head-quarters
on that morning; that a station was ordered opened in
the belfry of that Court-House, and another officer was
despatched thither for that duty; that after waiting some
time for the flags to appear he was ordered over to see
what the trouble was. He found the other officer sitting
under shelter, afraid to mount the belfry, nor could
any persuasion induce him to face that storm of shell.
Lieutenant Fuller thereupon climbed up into the belfry,
opened the station himself, and ran it during the whole
battle.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the command "Forward" was
sounded, and our brigade moved out towards Marye's
Heights. Some idea of the topography of Fredericksburg
and its rear I find is necessary to an understanding of
what follows. Marye's Heights, which encircle the city
back some five hundred yards, are the termination of a
plateau which rises from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred feet in an abrupt terrace from the plain upon
which the city stands. These heights form a half-circle
from the river above to a point below the city some little
distance from the river, and are from a mile to a mile
and a half long and are most admirably adapted for
defensive purposes. The rebel batteries, numbering at
least one hundred guns, were massed on these heights,
and covered not only every street leading out from the
city, but every square foot of ground of the plain below.
A third of the way down the terrace was an earthwork
filled with infantry, whilst at its foot ran the famous
stone wall extending southward from the cemetery above
the city, and was continued by an earthwork around the
whole circle. Behind this stone wall was massed a double
line of Confederate infantry. To enter either street leading
out to those heights was to face the concentrated fire
of that mass of artillery and the deadly work of those
three lines of infantry. Yet that was just what we had
before us.</p>

<p>Our division (French's) led the assault. Our regiment
brought up the rear of our brigade column. As
each regiment turned into the street leading out, it took
up the run to cover this exposed ground as quickly as
possible. Lieutenant-Colonel Albright was leading our
regiment and I was by his side. We passed rapidly up
the street, already covered with the dead and wounded
which had fallen from the regiments that had preceded
us, until we reached the embankment of a railroad, which
was nearly parallel with the enemy's works. A temporary
halt was made here preparatory to moving forward
in line of battle.</p>

<p>Turning to see that our men were in position, I was
amazed to find that we had but one company with us. It
was my duty as adjutant to go back and find and bring
up the balance of the regiment. The distance was about
four hundred yards. I can truthfully say that in that
moment I gave my life up. I do not expect ever again to
face death more certainly than I thought I did then. It did
not seem possible that I could go through that fire again
and return alive. The grass did not grow under my feet
going back. My sprinting record was probably made then.
It may be possible to see the humorous side at this distance,
but it was verily a life and death matter then. One may
ask how such dangers can be faced. The answer is, there
are many things more to be feared than death. Cowardice
and failure of duty with me were some of them. I can
fully appreciate the story of the soldier's soliloquy as he
saw a rabbit sprinting back from the line of fire:</p>

<p>"Go it, cotton tail; if I hadn't a reputation at stake, I'd
go to."</p>

<p>Reputation and duty were the holding forces. I said
to myself, "This is duty. I'll trust in God and do it. If
I fall, I cannot die better." Without the help and stimulus
of that trust I could not have done it, for I doubt if any
man was ever more keenly susceptible to danger than I,
and the experience of Antietam had taught me the full
force of this danger. The nervous strain was simply
awful. It can be appreciated only by those who have
experienced it. The atmosphere seemed surcharged with
the most startling and frightful things. Deaths, wounds,
and appalling destruction everywhere. As fast as I was
running back over that street, my eyes caught an incident
that I can see now, which excited my pity, though I had
no time to offer help. A fine-looking fellow had been
struck by a shot, which had severed one leg and left it
hanging by one of the tendons, the bone protruding, and
he was bleeding profusely. Some men were apparently
trying to get him off the street. They had hold of his
arms and the other leg, but were jumping and dodging
at every shell that exploded, jerking and twisting this
dangling leg to his horrible torture. I remember hearing
him beseeching them to lay him down and let him die.
They were probably a trio of cowards trying to get back
from the front, and were using this wounded man to get
away with, a not infrequent occurrence with that class of
bummers.</p>

<p>I found the balance of the regiment had passed our
street and were in confusion further down the main street.
As the second company was about turning to follow the
column a shell had exploded in their faces, killing and
wounding some ten men and throwing it into disorder.
Before it could be rallied the advancing column was out
of sight. It was the work of but a few moments to
straighten out the tangle and head them again for the
front. No body of men could have more quickly and
bravely responded, though they told me afterwards that
they read in my pallid face the character of the work
before them. Back we went up that street on the run,
having to pick our way to avoid stepping on the dead and
wounded, for the ground was now blue with our fallen
heroes.</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG&mdash;CONCLUDED</p>


<p>R<span class="smcap">eaching</span> the place in the rear of that railroad embankment,
where I had left the brigade, I found it had
just gone forward in line of battle, and a staff officer
directed me to bring the rest of the regiment forward
under fire, which I did, fortunately getting them into
their proper position. The line was lying prone upon
the ground in that open field and trying to maintain a
fire against the rebel infantry not more than one hundred
and fifty yards in our front behind that stone wall. We
were now exposed to the fire of their three lines of infantry,
having no shelter whatever. It was like standing
upon a raised platform to be shot down by those
sheltered behind it. Had we been ordered to fix bayonets
and charge those heights we could have understood the
movement, though that would have been an impossible
undertaking, defended as they were. But to be sent
close up to those lines to maintain a firing-line without
any intrenchments or other shelter, if that was its purpose,
was simply to invite wholesale slaughter without the
least compensation. It was to attempt the impossible,
and invite certain destruction in the effort. On this interesting
subject I have very decided convictions, which I
will give later on.</p>

<p>Proceeding now with my narrative, we were evidently
in a fearful slaughter-pen. Our men were being
swept away as by a terrific whirlwind. The ground was
soft and spongy from recent rains, and our faces and
clothes were bespattered with mud from bullets and fragments
of shells striking the ground about us, whilst men
were every moment being hit by the storm of projectiles
that filled the air. In the midst of that frightful carnage
a man rushing by grasped my hand and spoke. I turned
and looked into the face of a friend from a distant city.
There was a glance of recognition and he was swept away.
What his fate was I do not know.</p>

<p>That same moment I received what was supposed to
be my death wound. Whilst the men were lying down,
my duties kept me on my feet. Lieutenant Charles McDougal,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote-D" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote D.">[D]</a>
commanding the color company, called to me
that the color-guard were all either killed or wounded.
We had two stands of colors, the national and State flags.
These colors were carried by two color-sergeants, protected
by six color-corporals, which made up the color-guard.
If either sergeant became disabled the nearest corporal
took the colors, and so on until the color-guard were
down. This was the condition when this officer called to
me to replace these disabled men, so that the colors should
be kept flying. He had one flag in his hand as I approached
him, and he was in the act of handing it to me
when a bullet crashed through his arm and wrist, spattering
my face with his warm blood. I seized the staff as it
fell from his shattered arm. The next instant a bullet cut
the staff away just below my hand. An instant later I
was struck on the head by the fragment of a shell and fell
unconscious with the colors in my hand. How long I
remained unconscious I do not know, possibly twenty
minutes or more. What were my sensations when hit?
I felt a terrific blow, but without pain, and the thought
flashed through my mind, "This is the end," and then
everything was black. I do not remember falling. It
takes time to write this, but events moved then with
startling rapidity. From the time we went forward from
the embankment until the line was swept back could have
been but a few minutes, otherwise all must have been
killed.</p>

<p>When I revived I was alone with the dead and
wounded. The line of battle had been swept away. The
field about me was literally covered with the blue uniforms
of our dead and wounded men. The firing had
very perceptibly decreased. I had worn into the battle
my overcoat, with my sword buckled on the outside. I
had been hit on the left side of my head, and that side
of my body was covered with blood down to my feet,
which was still flowing. My first thought was as to my
condition, whether mortally wounded or not. I was perceptibly
weakened from loss of blood, but lying there I
could not tell how much strength I had left. I did not
dare move, for that would make me a target for the guns
that covered that terrible wall, the muzzles of which I
could plainly see. Many of them were still spitting out
their fire with a venom that made my position exceedingly
uncomfortable. What should I do? What could I do?
To remain there was either to bleed to death or be taken
prisoner and sent to Libby, which I felt would mean for
me a sure lingering death. To make a move to get off
the field would draw the fire of those guns, which would
surely finish me. These were the alternatives.</p>

<p>I carefully stretched my legs to test my strength, and
I made up my mind I had enough left to carry me off the
field, and I resolved to take my chances in the effort. I
determined that I would zigzag my course to the rear
so as not to give them a line shot at me. So getting
myself together I made a supreme effort and sprang up
and off in jumps, first to the right, then to the left. As
I expected, they opened on me, and the bullets flew thick
and fast about me. The first turn I got a bullet through
my right leg just above the ankle. It felt like the stinging
cut of a whip and rather accelerated my speed. About
fifty yards back was an old slab fence to my right, and I
plunged headlong behind that, hoping to find shelter from
those bullets. I fell directly behind several other wounded
men, two of whom rolled over dead from bullets that came
through the slabs and which were probably aimed at me.
This flushed me again, and by the same zigzag tactics
I succeeded in getting back to the railroad embankment,
where, to my great joy, I found Colonel Albright with
what remained of the regiment. Colonel Albright
grasped me in his arms as I came over, with the exclamation,
"We thought you were killed." Sergeant-Major
Clapp told me that he had rolled me over and satisfied
himself that I was dead before they went back.</p>

<p>As I reached cover under this embankment I remember
noticing a field-officer rallying his men very near us on
our right, and that instant his head was literally carried
away by a shell. So intense was the situation that even
this tragic death received only a passing thought. Then
came the Irish brigade, charging over our line as they did
at Antietam. They came up and went forward in fine form,
but they got but a few yards beyond the embankment,
when they broke and came back, what was left of them,
in great confusion. No troops could stand that fire.
Our division and the whole Second Corps, in fact, were
now completely disorganized, and the men were making
their way back to the city and the cover of the river-bank
as best they could, whilst the splendid old Ninth Corps
was advancing to take its place. Profiting by our experience,
they did not advance by those streets through which
we came, but made their way through houses and yards
and so escaped that concentrated fire on the streets. Their
advancing lines, covering the whole city front, looked
magnificent, and it was dreadful to think that such a
splendid body of men must march into such a slaughter-pen.
Their movement was a repetition of ours. With
bayonets unfixed they moved forward and attempted to
maintain a firing-line under Marye's Heights on the
ground from which we had been driven, only to be hurled
mercilessly back as we had been. Our line had been the
first to make this effort, and for some reason we had
approached to within about one hundred yards of their
main line of infantry, much closer than any of the troops
that followed. The others had barely got beyond the embankment,
when they were swept away. We, having approached
nearer their line, were, of course, longer exposed
to their fire and lost more heavily.</p>

<p>I was always curious to know why we of the first line
of that fateful movement succeeded in getting so much
nearer their works than the equally brave and determined
men who followed us. Some years afterwards on revisiting
this location I met an ex-Confederate who commanded
one of the rebel batteries on those heights that
day. In answer to my questions, he said the first
"Yankee" line was permitted to approach much nearer
than those that followed, for, said he, "we knew they
were our meat, and when we finally opened on them
with our full force, the slaughter was so awful it made
me heart sick. But you kept coming with such persistency
that we did not dare repeat those tactics." This
may have been partially true so far as concerned their
infantry fire, but a more potent reason, in my judgment,
was that we had developed the utter hopelessness of the
attempt, and men could not put heart into the effort.</p>

<p>Recurring to myself again, Colonel Albright stanched
the flowing of blood from my wound in the head by
making a strong compress of my large bandana handkerchief.
The other wound in my leg did not give me
much trouble then. In that condition, accompanied by
another wounded man, I made my way back into the
city. We found it one vast hospital. Every house was
literally crowded with wounded men. We were fortunate
enough to run against our brigade surgeon, who
had taken possession of a brick building on the main
street for hospital purposes. The only thing he could
give me to lie down upon was a wooden bench. We
had dismounted and left our horses with a servant when
we went forward, and our blankets, etc., were with them,
and where they were now there was no means of knowing.
I was therefore without those comforts. Everything
of that nature left by the rebels had long before
been appropriated. The doctor hastily examined my
wounds, pronounced them not dangerous, ordered the hospital
steward to dress them, and was away. He, however,
appropriated my red handkerchief. I had been
presented by a friend on leaving Scranton with two large
old-fashioned red silk bandana handkerchiefs, and they
were exceedingly useful. The doctor, seeing them, said,
"I must have these to nail up over the outside door to
show that this is a hospital," and, without so much as saying
by your leave, carried them off. The effort was to
secure as much protection as possible from the fire of the
enemy, and to do this the red flag of the hospital must be
displayed. It is against the rules of civilized warfare to
fire upon a hospital. The doctor said my red silk handkerchiefs
were the first red stuff of any kind he had been
able to get hold of. Of course I was glad to part with
them for that purpose, though they were worth at that
time $2 each in gold. The wound in my head was fortunately
a glancing blow from a fragment of a shell. It
tore the scalp from the bone about three inches in length
in the form of a V. It has never given me serious trouble,
more than to be a barometer of changing weather. The
wound in my leg nearly severed the big tendon. They
both quickly healed, and I was off duty with them but the
one day I took to get back to camp.</p>

<p>After my wounds had been dressed I tried to sleep,
being not only very weak from loss of blood, but almost
in a condition of nervous exhaustion. I laid down on my
bench, but shells were continually crashing through the
building, and sleep was impossible. I went out on the
street. It was crowded with wounded and straggling
soldiers. The stragglers were hunting for their regiments,
the wounded for hospital room. It seemed as if
the army must have disintegrated. This was practically
true of the Second and Ninth Corps, which had made the
assault. Towards night General French rode down the
street, accompanied by his staff. Seeing me, he stopped
his horse and exclaimed, "Adjutant, where is my division?
Tell me where my men are. My God, I am without
a command!" and the tears were flowing down his
red, weather-beaten face. He was beside himself over the
awful losses of his division. Well he might be, for a
great number of them were lying on yonder field in front
of Marye's Heights, and the balance were scattered
through the houses and on the river-bank practically
disorganized.</p>

<p>I was greatly alarmed for our safety that night. It
seemed to me highly probable that General Lee would
come down upon us and capture all that were in the city,
as he could easily have done. Possibly he was satisfied
with the damage already inflicted, and did not care to
assume the care of our wounded, which that would have
involved. I remained on my bench in that hospital
through that long night without food or covering. I had
eaten nothing since early morning. With the constant
whanging of shells through ours and adjacent buildings
and the moaning of the wounded lying all about me,
sleep or rest was impossible. It was a night too dreadful
to think of, and makes me shudder again as I write. We
remained in the city the next day, Sunday, and I rejoined
our regiment, which, with other troops, was lying under
the shelter of the river-bank. Officers were getting their
men together as far as possible and bringing order out of
chaos. We had Sunday about two hundred for duty out
of three hundred and fifty taken into the battle. On Monday,
the 15th, we who were wounded were told to make
our way across the river back to our old camps as best we
could. I was now very weak, and my head and leg were
very sore. The latter gave me much trouble in walking,
nevertheless there was a three-mile tramp before us.
Lieutenant Musselman, also wounded, went with me on
this weary tramp. We did not reach camp that night, and
so had to find shelter at a farm-house, already full of
straggling and wounded soldiers. The owner was a
widow, living with a grown-up daughter, and was a bitter
rebel, although professing Union sentiments whilst our
army was there. She was, of course, greatly annoyed by
the presence of these soldiers, most of whom were eating
up her provisions without paying for them. Some of
them were "bummers," who had run away from the
battle and had persuaded her to feed and shelter them for
the protection they professed to afford her. She was in
great wrath when we reached there and peremptorily forbade
us entering. But I told her firmly that we were
wounded men and must have shelter; that I would willingly
pay for accommodations, but, permission or not, the
latter we must have. This argument seemed to be convincing,
and the daughter led us up to the garret, which,
she said, was the only unoccupied room in the house.
Here she spread a blanket on the floor for us to sleep on.
I suppose this was the best she could do. Then, at our
solicitation, she got us some supper, an exceedingly frugal
meal, but we were glad to get that. The daughter did not
seem to share her mother's bitterness, but as often as she
could would interject a word in our favor, and really did
all she could for us. I sincerely hope she was ultimately
made a permanent prisoner by some good "boy in blue."
Here would have been an excellent opportunity to have
woven into this narrative the golden thread of romance.
This pretty secesh girl, with flashing blue eyes and golden
hair, rebel to the core, yet befriending a wounded Union
soldier, etc. How readily it lends itself, but the truth
must be told. The little arrow god had already driven
home his shaft, and so the romance could not mature.</p>

<p>During the evening General Franz Sigel and staff
came to the house and demanded supper. Our lady was
very polite, assured him that it was impossible. "Very
well," said General Sigel, "I think I shall want this place
to-morrow for a hospital. Madam, your kindness will be
reciprocated." He spoke very emphatically, whereat the
pretty daughter began to cry, and the mother to stammer
apologies, and said she would do the best she could for
them, but she really had nothing to cook. The general
retired very indignant. Whether or not his threat was
carried out I do not know, for the next morning we were
off without trying to get breakfast. On asking for her
bill we were surprised to find her charges were evidently
based on the highest war-time hotel rates. We had so
poor a supper that we had no desire for breakfast there,
and had slept on the garret floor. For this she demanded
one dollar. We paid her fifty cents, which was more than
double its worth, and left amidst a great volley of her
choicest anathemas.</p>

<p>We reached camp towards noon, and found we had
tramped about five miles out of our way. The regiment
was there ahead of us, the troops having evacuated
Fredericksburg on Monday, two days after the battle,
without opposition. We were actually under fire in this
battle, that is, from the time the assault began until we
were swept back, probably not more than thirty minutes
as against four and one-half hours at Antietam. Yet our
losses were proportionately much heavier. During my
absence on sick leave, our regiment, after leaving Warrenton,
had been detailed on heavy "fatigue" duty, loading
and unloading vessels and various kinds of laborer's
work at Belle-plain, and in consequence many were on
the sick list, others were on various details, so that when
we went into this battle we had only three hundred and
fifty men for duty, against seven hundred and fifty at
Antietam. Of this number my diary, written the 15th,
says we lost: Killed, 7; wounded, 80; missing, 20; total,
107. Lieutenant Hoagland, Company H, was killed. Of
the wounded, four were officers,&mdash;Captain Richard Stillwell
and First Lieutenant John B. Floyd, Company K;
First Lieutenant Musselman, Company E, and First Lieutenant
McDougal, commanding Company C. Lieutenant
McDougal's arm was shattered by a minie-ball whilst
handing me the colors, detailed above. Captain Stillwell
received a very singular wound. A bullet struck
the side of his neck near the big artery and appeared to
have gouged out a bit of flesh and glanced off. It bled
more than this circumstance would have seemed to warrant,
but the captain was sure he was not hurt and made
light of it. Swelling and pain speedily developed in his
shoulder, and it was found that the missile, instead of
glancing off, had taken a downward course and finally
lodged near his shoulder-joint, a distance of ten or twelve
inches from where it entered. He was given leave of
absence on account of wounds, and the ball was cut out
after his return home, and ultimately the whole channel
made by the ball had to be opened, when it was found
lined with whiskers which the ball had carried in with it.</p>

<p>Most of those computed above as missing were undoubtedly
killed, but had not been so reported at that time.
Our loss in that half-hour was nearly one-third. One
stand of our colors, the one whose staff was shot away in
my hand, was missing, and the other was badly torn by
shells and bullets.</p>

<p class="c smcap">WHY FREDERICKSBURG WAS LOST</p>


<p>I <span class="smcap">promised</span> to give my convictions relative to the
responsibility for the disaster of Fredericksburg, and I
might as well do it here.</p>

<p>Recalling the fact heretofore stated that we seemed to
have been thrown against Marye's Heights to be sacrificed;
that we were not ordered to charge their works,
but to advance and maintain a line of battle-fire where
such a thing was absolutely impossible, I come to the inquiry,
what was the character and purpose of the movement
and why did it fail? So thoroughly impressed was
I that there was something radically wrong about it, that
I determined to solve that question if possible, and so
made a study of the subject at that time and later after
my return home. I had personal friends in the First and
Sixth Corps, which had operated on the extreme left, and
I discussed with them the movements that day. Finally,
after my return home, I got access to Covode's congressional
reports on the conduct of the war covering that
campaign, and from all these sources learned what I then
and now believe to be substantially the facts about that
campaign. The army was divided into three grand divisions,
composed of two army corps each, namely, the Second
and Ninth, the right grand division, commanded by
Sumner; the First and Sixth, the left grand division,
commanded by Franklin, and the Third and Fifth, the
centre, commanded by Hooker. The plan of battle was to
hold Lee's army at Fredericksburg by a "feint in force"
(which means an attack sufficiently strong to deceive the
enemy into the belief that it is the real or main attack) at
that point, whilst the left grand division was to throw a
pontoon bridge across the river three miles below and turn
his flank (<i>i.e.</i>, get behind them) in the rear of Marye's
Heights. For this purpose the left grand division was to
advance and attack vigorously. If successful, Lee would
then have been between Franklin's forces on the left and
our own on the right, with every possibility of being
crushed. Hooker was to hold his division in readiness to
support either wing. Had this plan been carried out,
our work at the right would, at its conception, have been
as it appeared to be, a mad sacrifice of men, but with an
opportunity later on of pushing forward and reaping a
victory. In that event, our position would have made
us a tremendous factor in the result.</p>

<p>Now how was the plan carried out? The student will
be puzzled on finding such a paucity of records concerning
this disastrous movement. The official documents are
remarkable for what they do not contain. A study of
Covode's reports on the conduct of the war will, I think,
justify my conclusions, viz., that the disaster of Fredericksburg
was due not to accident, nor to a faulty plan
of battle, but to a failure of the left grand division to perform
the vital part assigned to it. My information gained
at the time was that Franklin was to remain concealed
until the signal for our attack came; then he was to cross
over and attack vigorously, a military expression, meaning
to put all possible vigor and power into the movement.
The signal was given as our attack began. Whatever
force may have crossed the river at that time, my information
was that the division known as the Pennsylvania
Reserve, now numbering probably not more than six
thousand men, under General Meade, was the only body
of troops which made a determined attack on Lee's right,
in support of our work in front of Marye's Heights.
Realizing the opportunity, General Meade pushed forward
with his usual vigor and, though meeting strenuous opposition,
soon found himself well in Lee's rear, but without
support. He sent back aide after aide to hurry forward
the supporting lines, but without avail, finally galloping
back himself. He found General Birney resting near the
bridge with his division. An eye-witness<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote-E" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote E.">[E]</a> to Meade's
interview with Birney says the language of General
Meade as he upbraided Birney for not coming to his
support was enough to "almost make the stones creep;"
that Meade was almost wild with rage as he saw the
golden opportunity slipping away and the slaughter of his
men going for naught. He said Birney responded that he
agreed with General Meade fully, and was ready and
most anxious to come to his support, but that his orders
were peremptory to await further orders in his present
position: that he had been for an hour trying to find
General Franklin to obtain permission to move forward.
This loss of time and want of support to Meade's charge
changed a possible victory into a fearful disaster. This
was substantially the testimony of Major-General Reynolds,
commanding the First Corps, before the Committee
on the Conduct of the War. Burnside rode down to the
left and vigorously expostulated with Franklin for his
failure to carry out his orders, and peremptorily ordered
him to make the attack as originally directed, whilst he
repeated the movement at the right. It was now considerably
after noon, and this order was undoubtedly a
mistake. The plan of battle had been revealed, and there
was practically no hope of success. Had the left grand
division vigorously performed its part in the earlier movement,
can any one doubt the result? I cannot think so.
Had Meade, Reynolds, or Hancock been in command on
the left that day, I feel confident that Fredericksburg
would have been recorded a glorious victory instead of
a horrible slaughter.</p>

<p>Now, why did the left grand division fail to make the
attack as ordered? Halleck, in his report on the operations
at Fredericksburg, says "alleged misunderstanding
of orders." Here is his language:</p>

<p>"It was intended that Franklin's grand division, consisting
of the corps of Reynolds (First) and Smith
(Sixth), should attack the enemy's right and turn his position
on the heights in the rear of Fredericksburg, while
Sumner and Hooker attacked him in front. But by some
alleged misunderstanding of orders Franklin's operations
were limited to a mere reconnoissance, and the direct
attacks of Sumner and Hooker were unsupported."
"Rebellion Records," vol. xxi., page 47.</p>

<p>Is the theory of a misunderstanding of orders tenable?
The records show that on the 11th of December, two
days before the battle, Burnside ordered his division commanders
to so dispose their troops as to bring them within
easy reach of Fredericksburg, and that on that day at
twelve o'clock noon these officers were ordered to meet
him personally at his head-quarters for final instructions.
There are no records of what those instructions were, but
is it credible that either general retired from that conference
with a misunderstanding as to the plan of battle or
of his own part in it? Certain it is that neither Sumner
nor Hooker misunderstood.</p>

<p>And the excuse said to have been made by Franklin,
that he did not deem the attack on the left practicable, is
not consistent with the idea of misunderstanding. Otherwise,
why did he attack at all? General Halleck's guarded
language clearly indicates where he placed the responsibility
for that disaster, and that he did not credit the
"misunderstanding of orders" theory. It is plainly evident
Burnside did not accept that excuse, as appears from
his celebrated Order No. 8, issued a month later, relieving
Franklin, Smith, Newton, Cochran, and Ferrero, and
stating as his reason that "it being evident that these
officers can be of no further service to this army,"&mdash;the
first named being the commander of the left grand division,
the second the commander of the Sixth Corps, and
the others subordinate commanders in that wing of the
army. General Burnside explained to the Committee
on the Conduct of the War<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote-F" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote F.">[F]</a> that in asking the President
to approve this order, and making that a condition
upon which he would consent to remain at the head
of the army, he had explicitly stated, "that was the
only condition on which he could command the Army of
the Potomac." In other words, he could not command
that army with those officers as his subordinates. The
inference that there had been insubordination is inevitable.
It was the current belief amongst us officers of the army
that the battle of Fredericksburg had been lost through a
want of hearty co-operation, if not direct disobedience of
orders, on the part of the officer commanding on the left
that day, and some of his subordinates, and that this was
due to a spirit of jealousy. McClellan had but recently
been removed from the command of the army, and the
officers relieved were strong personal friends and partisans
of the latter. Again, Burnside, his successor, was alleged
to be junior in actual rank to Franklin. Whether either
of these facts supplied the motives for the jealousy which
lost that battle, if such was true, the judgment day alone
will reveal. It is devoutly to be hoped that the light of
that day will relieve the terrible disaster of Fredericksburg
of this awful shadow, and that nothing worse than a
"misunderstanding of orders" was responsible for it.</p>

<p>That Order No. 8 was disapproved at Washington, and
General Burnside promptly tendered his resignation of the
command of the Army of the Potomac. He felt that he
had not received and was not likely to receive the cordial
and hearty support of all his subordinate officers, and
under those circumstances he did not want the responsibility
of command. He expressed himself as anxious
to serve his country and willing to work anywhere it
might please the President to place him. He was not
relieved, however, until a month or so later. In writing
the foregoing I know that many brave men will take exception.
I would say, however, that I have made a somewhat
careful study of the subject from an absolutely unprejudiced
stand-point, and such are the conclusions I
reached, and they were shared by many of my fellow-officers
who were in that campaign. The losses in this battle
amount to nearly one-third the troops actually engaged,
a most remarkable fact, and which stamps this engagement
as one of the bloodiest in all history. Burnside reports
his loss as twelve hundred and eighty-four killed and nine
thousand six hundred wounded, making a total loss, including
the missing, of twelve thousand six hundred and
fifty-three. Of this loss the right grand division (the
Second and Ninth Corps) lost five thousand three hundred
and eleven. The left grand division, Franklin's (First
and Sixth Corps, which numbered considerably more than
the right grand division), lost three thousand four hundred
and sixty-two, and most of this was sustained in the
second attack in the afternoon. These facts sustain the
belief above referred to in the army, that the main attack
in the morning on the left was not what it should have
been, and was the cause of the disaster.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact connected with this loss is the
great number of wounded as compared with the killed.
Usually the former exceeds the latter in the proportion
of three and four to one, but at Fredericksburg it was
nearly nine to one. How this is to be explained I never
understood, unless it be that most of the casualties were
from exploding shells. The minute fragments of a shell
scatter very widely and wound, whilst there are fewer of
the large pieces which kill. For example, the shell that
exploded in the front of our second company, as it was
turning to enter the street leading out towards Marye's
Heights, previously described, knocked out ten men, only
one of whom was instantly killed. It is safe to estimate
that of the nine thousand six hundred reported as
wounded, one-third died or were permanently disabled
therefrom.</p>

<p>To show how quickly troops can recover from such a
shock as the disaster of Fredericksburg, the Second Corps
had a grand review back of Falmouth the second week
after the battle. Major-General Edwin V. Sumner, commanding
the right grand division, was the reviewing officer.
I have spoken before of this distinguished officer.
This was his farewell to the Second Corps, which he had
long commanded and to which he was greatly attached, a
sentiment which was most cordially reciprocated by the
men. He was now probably the oldest in years of all the
officers in the army, yet still vigorous, intrepid, and efficient.
He was relieved from active command in the field
and assigned to the command of the Department of the
Ohio, but a few months later died peacefully at his home
in New York. Is it not singular that this old hero should
have escaped the numberless missiles of death in all
the battles through which he had passed, so soon to succumb
in the quietude of retirement?</p>

<p>Our regiment had present at this review but few over
two hundred men, and the other regiments were proportionally
small, so that the corps was scarcely larger than
a good-sized division, yet it appeared in splendid condition.
Its depleted numbers and battle-scarred flags alone
told the story of its recent experiences. The following
week our regiment was detailed for a ten-days' tour of
picket duty, and was encamped some distance above Falmouth
in a pretty grove. This change of service was a
welcome one to the men in many respects, for there was
better foraging opportunities, and there was also considerable
excitement attending this service in the presence of
the enemy. The Rappahannock River was the dividing
line of the two armies, and their respective pickets lined
its banks. At this time the two lines were kept as far as
possible concealed from each other, though there was
practically no picket firing. Later on the two lines were
posted in full view of each other, and by agreement under
a "flag of truce" all picket firing was strictly forbidden.
Thereafter, although forbidden, there was more or less
conversation carried on between the two lines.</p>

<p class="c smcap">LOST COLORS RECOVERED</p>


<p>I<span class="smcap">n</span> addition to our heavy loss of men at Fredericksburg
was the loss of our colors, the stand whose staff had
been shot away in my hand as described in a former
chapter.</p>

<p>It can be well understood that we felt very keenly the
loss of our flag, although we knew that it had been most
honorably lost. It was known to have been brought off
the field in the night by Corporal William I. D. Parks,
Company H, one of the color-guard, who was mortally
wounded, and left by him in a church used as a temporary
hospital. Corporal Parks was removed to a hospital at
Washington, where he died shortly afterwards, and the
colors mysteriously disappeared. The act of this color-bearer
in crawling off the field with his colors, wounded as
he was to the death, was a deed of heroism that has few
parallels. We made every effort to find the flag, but without
success, and had concluded that it must have been left
in Fredericksburg, and so fallen into the hands of the
enemy, when a couple of weeks after the battle, on returning
from a ride down to Falmouth, I noticed a regiment
of our troops having dress parade. I rode near them,
and my attention was at once attracted to the fact that
they paraded three stands of colors, a most unusual circumstance.
My suspicion was at once aroused that here
were our lost colors. Riding closer, my joy was great
on recognizing our number and letters on their bullet-and
shell-tattered folds, "132 P. V." Anger immediately succeeded
my joy as I saw that our precious colors were
being paraded as a sort of trophy. This flag, under whose
folds so many of our brave men had fallen, and which
had been so heroically rescued from the field, exhibited
to the army and the world as a trophy of the battle by
another regiment! It was, in effect, a public proclamation
of our cowardice and dishonor and of their prowess in
possessing what we had failed to hold and guard, our
sacred colors. It stung me to the quick. I do not remember
ever to have been more beside myself with anger.
It was with difficulty that I contained myself until their
ceremony was over, when I rode up to the colonel, in the
presence of all his officers, and in a voice which must
have betrayed my emotion, demanded to know why he
was parading our colors. His reply was, "Those are
the colors of a d&mdash;&mdash;d runaway regiment which my men
picked up on the battle-field of Fredericksburg." My
hair and whiskers were somewhat hot in color those days,
and I have not kept a record of my language to that
colonel for the next few minutes. I sincerely hope the
recording angel has not. Still, I am sure it was the explosion
of a righteous indignation.</p>

<p>Full of wrath I galloped at topmost speed to camp and
made known my discovery to Colonel Albright. If I
was "hot," what shall be said of him? Of a fiery, mercurial
disposition, his temper flew in a moment. He
mounted his horse and bade me lead him to this regiment.
The brave heralds who carried "the good news
from Ghent to Aix," did not gallop faster than did we
two, and the wicked fellow who was hired to say two
dollars' worth of "words" for the Quaker did not do his
work a bit more effectively than did my brave colonel in
denouncing the man who had made that charge of cowardice
against our regiment. Well, he began to hedge immediately.
He evidently saw that there was trouble
ahead, and offered to give us the colors at once, but
Colonel Albright peremptorily refused to accept them that
way, and said he would demand a court of inquiry and
would require full and complete vindication, cost what it
might. A court of inquiry was at once asked for and
granted. It was made up of officers outside of our division,
and was directed to investigate the loss of our flag,
and how it came into the possession of this other regiment.
Colonel Albright was a good lawyer and conducted his
own case before the court. It came out in the investigation
that in making his report of the part his regiment
took in the battle of Fredericksburg this colonel had used
substantially the same language he had to me concerning
how he came into possession of the flag. Here is the
paragraph referring to our colors, taken from his report
printed in the "Rebellion Records," vol. xxi., page 275:</p>

<p>"I would also state that some cowardly members of a
regiment unknown (?) abandoned their colors, which
were recovered by Captain Northrup, of my regiment, and
saved the disgrace of falling into the hands of the enemy."
My diary notes that I interviewed this Captain Northrup,
and he promptly stated that he took the colors from the
hospital and brought them with him when their regiment
left Fredericksburg. He said he did not know how they
got into the hospital, but supposed a wounded sergeant
had left them there. He disclaimed any idea of their having
been abandoned in a cowardly manner, and could not
understand why his colonel had made such a declaration.
The statement that his men rescued them from an unknown
regiment was false upon its face, for our name
was inscribed on its folds in plain letters, "132d P. V."
Why he made such a statement, and why he treated the
colors as he did, I could never understand, for had the
statement been true it was outrageously unmilitary to proclaim
to the world the cowardice of one of our own regiments.
It was his duty to promptly send the colors to
head-quarters, with a statement of the facts, so that the
alleged runaways could be properly disciplined. As it
was, it seemed a most contemptible effort to secure a
little cheap, unearned glory. It was heartlessly cruel and
unworthy of a brave soldier.</p>

<p>The result of the court of inquiry was a full and complete
vindication of our regiment, as shown by the following
paragraph from an order issued by Major-General
O. O. Howard, commanding the Second Corps: "The
last color-bearer, badly wounded, left his regiment after
dark, and in the town entered a church used as a hospital,
taking his colors with him. He was carried away from
this place and the colors left behind. The very fidelity of
the color-bearer holding to his colors as long as he was
conscious was the occasion of their loss to the regiment.
Not only no fault should be found with this regiment, but
it should receive unqualified commendation."</p>

<p>General French, commanding our division, published
this order to the division, adding the following: "As the
commander of the division, and knowing the character
of the One Hundred and Thirty-second Pennsylvania
Volunteers, which has fought under my eye in two of the
bloodiest engagements of the war, and which has the
highest encomiums from its brigade commander, General
Kimball, who knows what brave men are, I have deemed
it my duty to make this record to go with whatever may
have transpired in reference to this subject during my
short absence." The above paragraphs were taken from
Bates's "History of Pennsylvania Volunteers." The
colors were ordered returned to us with proper military
honors. They were brought to General French's head-quarters
by a military escort from that regiment, and I
had the satisfaction of officially receiving them with a like
escort from our regiment, commanded by First Lieutenant
J. D. Laciar, of Company G. The ceremony was to us a
joyous and impressive occasion. It took place in the
presence of General Alfred Sully, temporarily commanding
the division, and staff, and our brigade officers. The
two escorts were drawn up, facing each other. The order
of Major-General Howard, above referred to, was read.
This was followed by a little speech from General Sully,
in which we came in for some more praise; then both
escorts presented arms, whilst their color-bearer transferred
the colors to ours, and the ceremony was over. A
happier escort never marched than was ours bearing home
those restored colors.</p>

<p>The weather was now getting very cold, and we set
about making ourselves as comfortable as possible in
camp. The men were allowed to fix up their tents as best
they could without much regard for architectural beauty
or regularity. Some of them dug cellars four to five feet
deep, made puncheon floors,&mdash;that is, floors made of split
logs smoothed off and laid the flat side up,&mdash;whilst the
sides were made of logs plastered up with mud. Mud
fireplaces were made with old barrels for chimneys. The
roofs were canvas, of course, but fairly waterproof. A
favorite bit of horse-play of the men at this time was to
watch when the occupants of some tent were having a
good time, and smoke them out by throwing a wet blanket
over the top of their barrel chimney. In about a second
the smoke would be almost dense enough to suffocate, and
every fellow would pile out and hunt for the culprit. Woe
be unto him if they found him. A favorite ruse on the
part of the culprit was to plunge into his tent and be
placidly snoring when the victims began their hunt.
Sometimes the simulation would be too sonorous, and
give him away, and then he had trouble on hand for the
next hour. The ingenuity of these sons of Belial in their
pranks was beyond description. I have laughed until
absolutely exhausted many a time. How did I know so
much about them? Well, I had two of the liveliest of
these boys in my office as clerks, and, as they were generally
in the fun, I was kept posted, and to tell the truth,
as long as it did not seriously transgress, and there was
fun in it, I knew nothing about it "officially." Often
have I seen these boys put up a job on some fellow quietly
sleeping, by smoking out his next-door neighbors and
then directing their attention to him as the culprit. To
see him hauled out of a sound sleep and mauled for something
he was entirely innocent of, vehemently protesting
his innocence, yet the more he protested getting the more
punishment, the rascals who put up the job doing most
of the punishing, I have nearly split my sides. Of course,
no one was seriously hurt. The victim knew enough to
keep his temper, and in the end enjoyed the lark as well
as the rest. I speak of these things, for they were the
oases in army life and drudgery. Except for them it
would have been unendurable. Seldom were things so
bad but that some bit of raillery would relieve the strain
and get up a laugh, and everybody would feel better.</p>

<p>We had a young fellow in one of the companies who
was certainly the most comical genius I ever saw. He
was known by a nickname only. No length of march and
no severity of service could curb his spirits. When all
were down in the dumps this fellow would perform some
monkey-shine that would make even a horse laugh, and all
would be in good spirits again. Colonel Albright used to
say he was worth his weight in gold. He was with us
until after Fredericksburg, where he was either killed or
wounded, and I do not remember to have seen him afterwards.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the men's winter-quarters. We officers
had our wall tents, and had them fixed up with
puncheon floors also, and sheet-iron stoves, so that as
long as we kept a fire burning all were fairly comfortable.
But wood fires would last but an hour or so without replenishing,
and so during the night we had great difficulty
in keeping warm. Some of the coldest nights my clerks
and myself took turns in keeping up our fire. I rather
prided myself on the construction of my bed. It was made
of two springy poles held in place by crotched sticks driven
into the ground. On the poles nailed crosswise was a
bottom made of barrel-staves, the hollow side down, and
on these was laid a bed of hay, kept in place by some
old canvas sacking. On cold nights the only article of
clothing we took off was our shoes or boots. Then rolling
ourselves in our blankets, with gum blanket outside tucked
well around our feet and the whole surmounted with our
overcoats, we managed to sleep pretty well. These
puncheon floors were all the proceeds of foraging. No
lumber of any kind was furnished by the government.
The men cut the trees and split the logs wherever they
could find them. Most of them were "backed" into camp
anywhere from one to four miles.</p>

<p>After this little of note occurred in camp until Christmas.
We had made ourselves as comfortable as we could
with the materials at hand, which were not in super-abundance.
The weather was what we were told was
characteristic of Virginia winters,&mdash;rather mild, slush and
mud, with its raw, disagreeable dampness, being the prevailing
conditions. It was exceedingly trying to our men,
and many, in consequence, were on the sick list. My diary
notes that on Christmas day we actually had a little sunshine,
and that by way of adding good cheer to the occasion
a ration of whiskey was issued to the men. The
ration consisted of a gill for each man. Each company
was marched to the commissary tent, and every man received
his gill in his cup or drank it from the measure,
as he preferred. Some of the men, who evidently were
familiar with the intricacies of repeating in ward elections,
managed in various ways to repeat their rations of this
vile stuff until we had a good deal more than a gill of
whiskey's worth of hilarity in camp. However, the noise
was winked at, believing it would soon subside and pass
off. All drills were suspended and the men were allowed
passes freely out of camp, being required to be in quarters
promptly at taps. The officers passed the day visiting
and exchanging the compliments of the season. The wish
for a "Merry Christmas" was about all there was to
make it such. I remember our bill of fare for Christmas
dinner consisted of boiled rice and molasses, "Lobskous"
and stewed dried apples. The etymology of the euphonious
word "Lobskous" I am unable to give. The dish
consisted of hardtack broken up and thoroughly soaked
in water, then fried in pork fat. I trust my readers will
preserve the recipe for a side dish next Christmas. One
of the boys, to show his appreciation of this extra fare
for Christmas dinner, improvised the following blessing:</p>

<p class="poem">"Good Lord of love<br />
Look down from above<br />
And see how a soldier's grub has mended,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slushed rice, Lobskous, and shoat,</span><br />
Where only hardtack and hog were intended."</p>

<p>The day was not without its fun, however. Among
other things, an impromptu foot-race was gotten up between
the Fourth New York and our regiment. The former
regiment, with which we were now brigaded, was
from New York City, and in its general make-up was
decidedly "sporty." They had in their ranks specimens
of almost all kinds of sports, such as professional boxers,
wrestlers, fencers, and runners. One of the latter had
been practising in the morning, and some of our boys had
remarked that "he wasn't much of a runner," whereupon
they were promptly challenged to produce a man who
could beat him, for a cash prize of twenty dollars in gold.
Win or lose, our fellows were not to be bluffed, and so
promptly accepted the challenge. Back they came to camp
with their "bluff," to look up a man to meet this professional.
So far as our men were concerned, it was
another case of the Philistine defying the armies of Israel.
Where was our David? All hands entered into the fun,
from the colonel down. The race was to be a one-hundred-yard
dash from a standing mark. We found our
man in Corporal Riley Tanner, of Company I. He was
a lithe, wiry fellow, a great favorite in his company, and
in some trial sprints easily showed himself superior to all
of the others. He, however, had never run a race, except
in boys' play, and was not up on the professional tactics
of such a contest. It was decided that the affair should
take place at five o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, on our regimental front,
and should decide the championship of the two regiments
in this particular. The course was duly measured and
staked off, and was lined on both sides by a solid wall of
the men, nearly our whole division being present, including
most of the officers. If the championship of the
world had been at stake, there could hardly have been
more excitement, so much zest did every one put into it.
On the minute the Goliath of the bloody Fourth appeared,
clad in the most approved racing garb. He was a stockily
built young Irishman, and looked decidedly formidable,
especially when our poor little David appeared a moment
later, with no other preparation than his coat and cap off
and pants rolled up. Nevertheless, our boys thoroughly
believed in him, and we all gave him a rousing cheer.
The signal was given and away leaped our little champion
like a frightened deer, literally running away from the
professional from the start and beating him leisurely in
the end by more than a dozen feet. Great was the furore
which followed. The victor was carried on the shoulders
of his comrades of Company I triumphantly back to his
quarters, and afterwards through all the company streets,
the victim of an immense popularity. Corporal Tanner,
scarcely beyond his teens, was a good, brave, and true
young man, popular with his comrades and faithful in
all his duties. Was this little race, so short and gloriously
won, prophetic of his life's brief course? He came home
to survive but a few years, and then die of injuries received
in the service. He was as much a sacrifice upon
the altar of his country as if he had been killed in battle.
He was long ago laid to rest in a soldier's grave. But
he still lives in the hearts of his comrades.</p>

<p>Here let me say a few words of our "friends, the
enemy," we had just beaten, the Fourth New York. Its
colonel was a Scotchman named McGregor, and he was a
true McGregor, a splendid officer. He was in command
of the brigade after Colonel Andrews was wounded at
Fredericksburg, until himself disabled by a wound. His
lieutenant-colonel was a captain in the New York police
force when he entered the service, and after the war as
Inspector Jameson he achieved a national reputation. He
was a splendid fellow personally, and physically a king
among men. He stood six feet two inches, beautifully
proportioned, square, and straight as an Indian, with heavy
jet black hair and whiskers, and an eye that I imagine
could almost burn a hole in a culprit. He could be both
majestic and impressive when occasion required, and was
more gifted in all these things than any man I ever knew.
The following incident will illustrate his use of them. I
met him in Washington whilst returning to my regiment
the day before the battle of Fredericksburg. I joined him
just before reaching the wharf where we were to take the
boat. He had been up to Washington on a day's pass, all
any one could then get, and had for some reason overstayed
his leave. I think he had missed his boat the day
before. In consequence he could not get a pass through
the lines to go back. I asked how he expected to get
through the provost guard. "Oh, that's easy," he said.
"Just watch me go through," and I did. There was a
double guard at the entrance to the boat and a sergeant
and lieutenant examining all passes. Jameson threw his
cape over his shoulders to conceal his shoulder-straps, put
on one of his majestic airs, looked the officer through, as
much as to say, you do not presume to question my rights
here, and waved him and the guards aside, and deliberately
stalked aboard, as though he commanded the army.
I came meekly along behind, pass in hand. The officer
had by that time recovered himself sufficiently to ejaculate,
"Who the h&mdash;l is that&mdash;general?" I repeated the
ejaculation to the colonel afterwards to his great amusement.
He was all right, and on his way to rejoin his
regiment, where he was wounded next day, splendidly
doing his duty. Because he had overstayed his leave
twenty-four hours, red tape would have required him to
remain in Washington, submit to a court-martial or court
of inquiry, and probably after three or four weeks be sent
back, duly excused, the country being deprived of his services
in the mean time.</p>

<p>Well, to get back to Christmas. After the foot-race the
men were given free rein until ten o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and passes
out of camp were not required. As the evening wore on,
it became evident that John Barleycorn had been getting
in some extra work, from the character of the noise emanating
from the company streets, and I became somewhat
nervous about it. Lieutenant-Colonel Albright's tent adjoined
mine, and I could see that he was becoming a little
exercised over this extra noise. The fear was that we
might get a peremptory summons from division head-quarters
to "explain immediately the causes of the unusual
noises emanating from our regiment, and why it is
not suppressed." Just about ten o'clock there was an
extra outburst, and I noticed Colonel Albright, with sword
dangling, pass rapidly out of his tent and down towards
the company streets from whence the noise came. I feared
trouble, and slipped on my boots and followed as quickly
as possible. But before I reached the scene, the colonel
had drawn his sword and ordered all the men to their
quarters, at the same time striking right and left with the
flat of his sword, hitting two of the men. One proved to
be a sergeant who was trying to quell the noise and get
his men into quarters. The latter resented the blow and
made a sharp retort to the colonel, who immediately repeated
it, whereupon the sergeant struck him a terrible
blow in the eye with his fist, knocking him down. I got
there just in time to see the colonel fall, and immediately
seized the sergeant and placed him in arrest. He was
handed over to the division provost guard. The colonel
was found to be seriously hurt. His eye swelled up and
turned black and gave him great pain all night. And it
was several days before he recovered the use of it.</p>

<p>The most serious thing about this unfortunate culmination
of our Christmas festivities was not only the breach
of discipline, but the present status of this sergeant. He
was an exceptionally good non-commissioned officer, with
a splendid record in both battles and in all service, yet he
had now committed an offence the punishment for which,
in time of war, was death,&mdash;viz., striking his superior
commissioned officer. The next day Colonel Albright reported
the affair to General French, commanding the division,
who promptly advised him to prefer charges against
the culprit and make an example of him. The matter was
generally discussed by both officers and men in camp, and
although it was felt that the sergeant had committed a
grave offence, yet that the colonel was in a measure responsible
for it. The latter was justly popular with all as
a brave officer and good man, yet he had been guilty himself
of an offence which had brought upon him the blow
he had received. He had no right to strike a soldier as he
did, even with the flat of his sword. Nor was it the
proper thing for him to take the place of his "officer of
the guard" or "officer of the day" in enforcing his own
orders regulating camp discipline. He should have sent
for the latter and required them to do their duty in the
matter. As a matter of fact, this was just what the
officer of the day was doing when the colonel appeared.
The colonel sent for me next morning, on his return from
General French's head-quarters, and freely told me of the
advice of the latter, and indicated his purpose to proceed.</p>

<p>This splendid man has long since entered into rest. No
truer man or braver officer entered the service than he,
and it has been one of the greatest satisfactions of my
life that I was able to possess his confidence to the fullest
degree. He invited my views now and he afterwards
thanked me for the service I then rendered him by opposing
his contemplated action. He was still suffering
very much from his injury and was in a poor mood to
brook opposition. Nevertheless I felt that if he subjected
this man to the possible results of a court-martial, later on
he would never forgive himself, and I so told him. I
reminded him of the mistake he had made in assuming
the duties of his "officer of the day," and of his graver
error, if not offence, in striking the men; that such action
would be very likely to produce similar results with almost
any of the men upon whom it might be committed; that
he had failed to respect the rights of his men even in
matters of discipline, and that all this being true, it would
be a mistake he would always regret if he failed to treat
this affair in as manly and generous a way as discipline
would permit. It was an occasion of keen regret that I
had to differ with Colonel Albright, for I really loved the
man. He dismissed me rather cavalierly with his thanks
for my drastic frankness. By his direction a meeting of
all the officers of the regiment was summoned to meet at
his head-quarters in the afternoon to give their views as
to the course to be pursued. The question, as submitted
by the colonel being one purely of discipline, seemed to
admit of but one treatment,&mdash;viz., court-martial; and this
was the unanimous sentiment as expressed in this meeting,
although outside, I well knew nearly all had expressed
themselves differently. Perhaps the way the colonel took
to get their views was partly responsible for his failure to
get their real feelings. He began with the youngest lieutenant
and asked each officer up to the senior captain, what
he thought the offence merited. The answer was, "I suppose
court-martial." None seemed willing to accuse the
colonel of his own error, and to have answered otherwise
would have involved that, so they simply replied as above.</p>

<p>The colonel said, after all had given their answers, that
the adjutant did not agree with him nor them, and called
on me to state my position, saying I was to be excused, as
he supposed the sergeant was a personal friend. Whilst
it was true that I had known him at home, I disclaimed
being influenced by that fact in this matter. The colonel,
to my relief, adjourned the meeting without announcing
his determination. I felt sure that a little more time
would bring him to my way of thinking, and so it turned
out. I saw the sergeant over at the provost-guard tent,
and found him very anxious about his situation and thoroughly
sorry for his hasty conduct towards the colonel,
whom he sincerely respected. He said he felt terribly
hurt at being so roughly treated. He was not to blame
for the noise, but was actually doing his best to quiet the
noisy ones and get them into quarters when the first intimation
he had of the colonel's presence was the blow from
his sword. He said this blow hurt him and roused his
anger and he replied sharply, and on getting the second
blow he struck without stopping to think of the consequences.
I told the colonel of this conversation, and said
if he would permit this man to express to him personally
his sorrow for his conduct, and, under the circumstances,
restore him to duty with no greater punishment than a
loss of his rank as sergeant, I felt sure he would win the
hearts of all the men and do an act he would always be
glad of. Two days later, to my great joy, he ordered me
to prepare an order practically embodying my recommendations,
the order to be read at dress parade that day,
and the prisoner to be publicly released at that time. I
think I never performed a more willing or difficult task
than reading that order on parade that afternoon. Just
before the ceremony, the sergeant had been brought by
the provost guard to the colonel's tent and had, in a manly
way, expressed his sorrow for his act. The colonel had
stated this fact to the regiment, and then directed me to
read the order releasing the prisoner and restoring him to
duty. The tears blinded my eyes and my emotions almost
choked my voice as I tried to read, and I doubt if there
was a dry eye in the ranks when I had finished. The outcome
of the unfortunate affair was exceedingly satisfactory.
The colonel, always popular, had now the hearts of
all&mdash;officers and men.</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE WINTER AT FALMOUTH</p>


<p>O<span class="smcap">ur</span> brigade was now commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Marshall, Tenth New York Volunteers, who was the
senior officer present for duty, Colonels Kruger, First
Delaware, and McGregor, Fourth New York, being absent
on account of wounds received at Fredericksburg, and
Colonel Wilcox, of our regiment, absent, sick. I mention
this to show how the exigencies of the service thrust
upon junior officers the duties and responsibilities of much
higher grades. Here a lieutenant-colonel was discharging
the duties appertaining to a general; sergeants frequently
commanded companies, whilst a captain in command of a
regiment was not an infrequent thing. These junior officers
performing the duties of higher grades got no more
compensation than the pay of their actual rank. On the
24th of January, Colonel Wilcox sent in his resignation,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Albright was commissioned colonel.
Major Shreve was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel,
and I had the honor to receive the rare and handsome
compliment of an election to the office of major, although,
being a staff-officer, I was not in the regular line of promotion.
Sergeant-Major Clapp succeeded to my position
as adjutant, and Private Frank J. Deemer, Company K,
who had been a clerk in my office, was appointed sergeant-major.
Just at this time I had a somewhat singular experience.
I had received a three-days' leave of absence
with permission to visit Washington on business for the
officers. This detail I mention because no leaves of absence
other than for sickness or disability were obtainable
at this time, except on urgent business for the officers of
a regiment, and for but one officer to a regiment, and
three days was the limit. To get to Washington&mdash;only
about sixty miles away&mdash;I had to start from camp before
daylight in the morning, ride three miles to the railroad
in a heavy, springless army wagon, across fields
and over rutted roadways that were barely passable,
the jolting of which was almost enough to shake one's
bones loose; then ride twenty miles in a freight car,
perched on whatever truck one could get a seat on, thence
by boat to Washington. The morning was exceptionally
cold and I had to leave without breakfast; the result was
I caught a severe cold, and when I reached my destination
I was suffering terribly from an attack of dysentery. I
was barely able to get to the Ebbitt House, the clerk of
which seeing my plight summoned a physician, who had
me sent to the Seminary Hospital for Officers at Georgetown.
Here I received most excellent care.</p>

<p>This institution was for officers only. There must have
been upward of two hundred sick and wounded officers
there at that time. It was under strict military rules.
The surgeon in charge was its commanding officer, as
absolute as though a general commanding a division in
the field. When I reached the hospital I was registered,
put to bed, and all clothing and personal effects taken
from me. A warm bath followed with the assistance of
a stalwart nurse and medicines were administered, and
I soon found relief in a refreshing sleep. A couple of
days later I had a remarkable visit. I was not allowed to
sit up yet, but a fine-looking old gentleman, wearing the
insignia of a major-general, appeared at my cot and extended
his hand. His face was an exceedingly kind one
and his voice, if possible, more so. His hair was white
and he had the unmistakable appearance of advanced age,
though he stood fully six feet high and was still square
and unbent in form. He proceeded to say he had learned
that a young officer bearing the name of Hitchcock had
been taken suddenly very ill and sent to this hospital, and
inasmuch as his name was Hitchcock, he was doubly interested
to know, first how I was, and second who I was.
My visitor was none other than Major-General Hitchcock,
military attaché of President Lincoln's cabinet and the
first general commissioner for the exchange of prisoners
of war. I think he was a retired regular army officer
called from his retirement to special service as military
adviser of the president and now in charge of the bureau
for the exchange of prisoners of war. His call was very
pleasant, and I learned from him that all of our name in
this country were distantly related. That two brothers
came to this country with the Regicides and settled, one
in New Hampshire, the other at New Haven. He was
of the former stock, whilst I was from the latter. On
retiring he bade me call on him when well. I greatly
regret I never had the opportunity of returning his
gracious visit. On the cot next mine lay an officer convalescing
from a wound received at Fredericksburg. I
have forgotten his name, but we soon became well acquainted,
and he proved a valuable and companionable
acquaintance. He was the best posted man in military
tactics I ever met, and was thoroughly familiar with all its
branches from the school of the soldier to the grand tactics
of a division. It was very profitable pastime for me
to go over the tactics under his instruction, he illustrating
each battalion movement by the use of matches on the
coverlets of our cots. In that way I learned the various
tactical movements as I had never been able to do before,
and it was of immense value to me, having now been
promoted to the position of a field-officer. This hospital
was no better and in no wise different from those for
private soldiers, except that we were charged a per diem
for board, whereas there was no charge for the privates.
I thought I could return at the end of a week, and asked
to be discharged, but was rather curtly informed by the
surgeon in charge that when the time came for my discharge
he would inform me.</p>

<p>The papers now contained rumors of another movement
on foot, and, of course, I was very anxious to return. A
few days later, after an examination, the doctor gave me
my discharge. It was now ten days since I had left camp
on a three-days' leave, but my discharge from the hospital
operated as an extension, and I had no difficulty in
getting transportation and passes through the lines to
rejoin my regiment. I performed my errands for the
officers of the regiment, which consisted in getting various
articles for their comfort, and in several cases a bottle of
something to "keep the cold out." As I write, I have
before me, in perfect preservation, all the official papers
covering that trip. Here are copies of the papers required
to get back to the regiment. They will give an idea of the
conditions, getting in and out of Washington at that time,

<p class="top5">The word liquors above is erased with a pen. It is
difficult at this day to realize that Washington was surrounded
with a cordon of sentries. All places of entrance
and exit were under the strictest military surveillance.
General Martindale, as its military governor, was supreme
in authority. No one could come or go, and nothing be
taken in or out, without his permission.</p>

<p>The servant included in the above pass was a "contraband,"
picked up in Washington for the trip. There
were hundreds of them clamoring for an opportunity
to get down to the army. They were glad to do all
one's drudgery for the chance of going, for once there,
plenty of jobs could be found, besides the excitement
and attractions of "Uncle Sam's" army were to them
irresistible. I reached camp early in the evening and
delivered my supplies, the officers being promptly on
hand to receive them. The return of an officer from
"civilization" was an event of no ordinary moment, and I
had many calls that evening. The following anecdote of
Major-General Howard was told that evening, apropos of
the delivery of the "commissions" I had brought. The
general was well known to be uncompromising in his
opposition to the presence of liquor of any kind in camp, or
elsewhere, and especially among the members of his
official family. Yet shortly after the battle of Fredericksburg,
one of his staff had a present of a bottle of "old
Rye." He put it away until some time during the general's
absence he could safely bring it out and treat his
fellow-members of the staff. The opportunity came one
day when his chief announced his absence at army head-quarters
for a couple of hours, and mounted and rode
away. The hidden treasure was brought out and due
preparation made for the delectation of all hands, and he
was in the act of pulling the cork in front of his tent, when,
suddenly hearing the clatter of horse's hoofs, he looked up
just in time to see the general returning for a forgotten
paper. He had barely time to swing the bottle behind his
heels as he closed them in the position of a soldier, and
arose and respectfully saluted. The position and salute
were strictly according to army regulations, but with a
general's own staff such formality was not usual. The
general evidently caught the situation, for he was tantalizingly
deliberate in acknowledging the salute, and finally
remarked, with a twinkle in his eye, looking him full in
the face: "Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, your position is faultless and your
punctiliousness in saluting truly admirable. Were you
getting it ready to send to the hospital? Very commendable,
indeed; it will do so much good." And to the
hospital, of course, it had to go, much to the chagrin of
all the staff.</p>

<p>The event of special interest at this time was the movement
later known as the "mud march." Troops had for
three days been moving up the river, destination, of
course, unknown to us, but now they were returning, a
most sorry, mud-bedraggled looking crowd. We were
glad enough not to have been with them. Our corps had
been for a week under marching orders, to move at a
moment's notice, but the final order never came, and we
were spared this experience. Whatever the movement
was designed to be, it was defeated by plain, simple MUD.
It should be spelled in the largest capitals, for it was all-powerful
at this time. Almost immediately after the
movement began, it commenced to rain heavily. The
ground was already soggy from previous rains, and it
soon became a vast sea of mud. I have already spoken of
Virginia mud. It beggars description. Your feet sink
into it frequently ankle deep, and you lift them out with
a sough. In some places it seemed as bottomless as a pit
of quicksand. The old-established roads were measurably
passable, but, as I have heretofore explained, most of the
troops had to march directly across the fields, and here it
proved absolutely impossible to move the wagon-trains
and artillery any distance. This was the main reason why
the movement had to be abandoned. I saw many wagons
down over their hubs, stalled in the mire. And the guns
and caissons of a battery of artillery were stalled near our
camp, and had to be abandoned for the time. The horses
were saved from miring with great difficulty. A few days
later the guns and caissons were hauled out with ropes.</p>

<p>There were dead mules and mired and broken wagons
all along the route of the marching troops. The number
of animals that perished in this futile march must have run
up into thousands, killed by exposure over pulling or
miring. It should be understood that when the army
moves, and the mule trains of ammunition and rations are
ordered to move, they must go as long as it is physically
possible, mule or no mule. The lives of a thousand mules,
more or less, is nothing compared with the necessity of
having ammunition and rations at the proper place at the
required time. I saw one mule team stalled in one of these
sloughs. The heavy wagon was down so that the box
was in the mud and the four mules were wallowing in a
death struggle to get out. Harness was cut and they were
freed, all to no purpose. Their struggles had made the
slough like a stiff pudding, which was apparently bottomless;
the more they struggled the deeper they got. Finally
a chain was hooked about the neck of one of the leaders
and fastened to another wagon and the mule hauled out,
but with a broken neck. The experiment was repeated
in a modified way with the other leader, now over back
in the mire, but with no better results. The others had
ceased to struggle and were slowly sinking, and were mercifully
killed and allowed to bury themselves in the mire,
which they speedily did. It may be asked why more civilized
methods were not employed to extricate these valuable
animals. Why fence rails or timbers were not placed
under them as is usual? The answer is, there was not a
fence rail nor anything of that nature probably within ten
miles. Everything of this kind had long ago been used
for fire-wood for the soldiers' cooking. And as for timbers
there probably was not a stick nearer than Aquia
Creek, more than ten miles away. Again it may be wondered
why the chain was not passed around the mule's
body rather than his neck. Simply because the former
was impossible without running the risk of miring the
driver in the slough, and he was not disposed to run any
risk of that kind. Had this been practicable, it is doubtful
if the result would have been any better, for without
padding the chains would have killed or mangled the mule,
and there were no means at hand for that purpose. The
destruction of this class of property, always very severe
under favorable circumstances in the army, was during
this mud movement simply appalling. The loss of one or
more mules meant an abandonment of the wagon and its
contents to the weather in many instances, and the same
was true where a team was mired.</p>

<p>The rebels were evidently interested observers of this
mud march, for their pickets taunted ours with such questions
as "How d'ye like Virginia mud?" "Why don't
you 'uns come over?" "How are you, mud?" etc., and
they put up rude sign-boards on which were scrawled in
large letters, "Burnside stuck in the mud!" "Burnside's
name is Mud!" etc.</p>

</div>

<p>The "mud march" had evidently settled it that there
would be no further attempt to move until better weather
conditions prevailed, which could not reasonably be looked
for before April, and so we settled down for a winter
where we were, back of Falmouth. The several corps
were spread out, occupying an area extending from within
three miles of Fredericksburg, nearly down to the Potomac.
Our corps, the Second, was located nearest to
the latter city, and our picket lines covered its front to
Falmouth and some miles up the river. Our division, the
Third (French's), had the line from the railroad bridge
at Fredericksburg to Falmouth, something over two miles.
Being now a field-officer, my name was placed on the
roster of picket field-officers of the day. My first detail
on this duty came almost as soon as my commission. My
duties had hitherto been confined almost exclusively to
the staff or executive business of the regiment. Further
than making the necessary details of officers and men for
picket duty, I had never had anything to do with that
branch of the service. I had, therefore, only a smattering
knowledge of the theory of this duty. It may well be
judged, therefore, that I felt very keenly this lack, when
I received my order to report for duty as division field-officer
of the day, the following morning. Here I was
suddenly confronted with the responsibility of the command
of the picket forces covering the dividing line between
the two hostile armies. A demonstration of the
enemy was to be looked for any moment, and it was most
likely to occur on our front. I had hoped to have a few
days to study up and by observing its practical work get
some little idea of my new duties. But here was the
detail, and it must be obeyed. It should be explained that
the picket line consists of a cordon of sentinels surrounding
the army, usually from two to three miles from its
camp. Its purpose is to watch the enemy, and guard
against being surprised by an attack. Except for this
picket line, the main body of troops could never sleep with
any degree of safety. To guard against attacks of the
enemy would require it to remain perpetually under arms.
Whereas with its picket lines properly posted it may with
safety relax its vigilance, this duty being transferred to its
picket forces. This picket service being a necessity of
all armies is a recognized feature of civilized warfare.
Hence, hostile armies remaining any length of time in
position near each other usually make an agreement that
pickets shall not fire upon each other. Such agreement
remains in force until a movement of one or the other
army commences. Notice of such a movement is, of
course, never given. The other party finds out the fact
as best it can. Frequently the withdrawal or concealment
of the picket line will be its first intimation. Ordinarily,
picket duty is not only of the very highest responsibility,
but an exceedingly dangerous duty. Until agreements
to cease picket-firing are made, every sentinel is
a legitimate target for the sentinels or pickets of the
enemy, hence extreme vigilance, care, and nerve are
required in the performance of this duty.</p>

<p>The picket line in the presence of the enemy is generally
posted in three lines,&mdash;viz., First, the line of sentries;
second, the picket supports, about thirty yards in rear of
the sentries, and third, the guard reserves, about three
hundred yards farther in the rear, depending upon the
topography of the country. Each body constitutes one-third
of the entire force, <i>i.e.</i>, one-third is constantly on
duty as sentinels, one-third as picket supports, and one-third
as grand reserves. The changes are made every
two hours, usually, so that each sentry serves two
hours on "post" and four hours off. The latter four
hours are spent half on grand reserve and half as picket
supports. The supports are divided into companies, and
posted in concealed positions, near enough to the sentry
line to be able to give immediate support in case of attack,
while the grand reserves, likewise concealed, are held in
readiness to come to the assistance of any part of the
line. Ordinarily this part of the picket force is able to
sleep during its two hours of reserve service. The supports,
however, while resting, must remain alert and vigilant.
It being the duty of the picket-line to prevent a surprise,
it must repel any sort of attack with all its power.
In the first instance the sentinel must promptly challenge
any party approaching. The usual formula is: "Halt!
Who comes there?" The approaching party failing to
obey the command to halt, it is his duty to fire at once,
even though he be outnumbered a hundred to one, and it
cost him his life. Many a faithful sentinel has lost his
life in his fidelity to duty under such circumstances. For
although the picket is there to prevent a surprise, the
attacking party is equally bent on getting the advantage
of a surprise, if possible, and many are the ruses adopted
to capture sentinels before they can fire their guns. He
must fire his gun, even though he be captured or run
through with a bayonet the next instant. This gives the
alarm, and the other sentries and picket supports open fire
at once, and the reserves immediately join them, if necessary,
to hold or impede the progress of the enemy. It is
thus seen that in case of an attack the picket force finds
itself maintaining a fight possibly against the whole opposing
army, or whatever the attacking force may be.
Fight it must, cost whatever it may, so that time may be
gained to sound the "long roll" and assemble the army.
Many of our picket fights were so saucy and stubborn that
the attacks were nipped in the bud, the enemy believing
the army was there opposing them. In the mean time,
mounted orderlies would be despatched to army head-quarters
with such information of the attack as the officer
of the day was able to give.</p>

<p>Having now given some idea of picket service, I return
to my own first experiences as field-officer of the
day. I was fated to have several rather singular experiences
on that first day. The first occurred in connection
with my horse. I mounted and started for division head-quarters,
about a half-mile away, in ample time to reach
there a little before the appointed time&mdash;eight o'clock,
but reaching the outer edge of our camp my horse balked,
and in answer to my efforts to move him began to kick,
rear, and plunge. He tried to throw me, and did nearly
everything except roll over. Every time I headed him
forward, he would wheel around and start back for his
stable. I coaxed him, then tried the spur, all to no purpose.
I was losing valuable time, besides having a very
uncomfortable kind of a fight on hand. I realized I must
make him obey me or I could never handle him again. An
orderly from General French came galloping over with
the expected peremptory message. One minute's delay
with him was almost a capital offence. I could only return
word that I was doing my best to get there. The general
and his staff then rode over to see my performance. He
reassured me with the remark, "Stick to him and make
him obey you, or kill him." Well, it took just about one
hour to conquer him, at the end of which time I had
ploughed up several acres of ground, my horse was in a
white lather, and I was in the same condition. When he
quit, he did so at once, and went on as cleverly as though
nothing had happened. The cause of this freak I never
understood, he never having done so before, and never
did again.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Don">*May</a> I digress long enough to speak a little more of this
remarkable horse. Dr. Holland says there is always hope
for any man who has heart enough to love a good horse.
Army life was well calculated to develop the sterling qualities
of both man and beast. Hence, I suppose every man
who had a good horse could safely regard him as "most
remarkable." How many such have I heard cavalrymen
talk about, descanting on the "remarkable" qualities of
their half-human favorites, whilst the tears wet their
cheeks. I had named this splendid animal "Don Fulano,"
after that superb horse in Winthrop's "John Brent," not
because he was a magnificent black charger, etc.; on the
contrary, in many respects he was the opposite of the original
Don Fulano. Raised upon an unromantic farm near
Scranton, an unattractive yellow bay, rather too heavy
limbed and too stockily built to be called handsome, yet
powerful, courageous, intelligent (he could almost talk),
high spirited, with a heavy, shaggy mane and forelock,
through which gleamed a pair of keen, fierce eyes, he had
many of the qualities which distinguished his noble prototype.
He had not the high honor to die carrying a slave to
liberty, but when the final accounts come to be squared up
in the horses' heaven, it is possible that the credit of
having passed unflinchingly through the battles of Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville, and of having safely carried
a wounded soldier off each field may prove to be a
little something in favor of my splendid "Don." As a
saddler, he came to me practically unbroken. He was sold
from the farm because he would jump all fences, yet under
the saddle, when I took him, he would not jump the smallest
obstacle. This is really as much of an art on the part
of the rider as with the horse. An unskilled rider is liable
to seriously injure both the horse and himself in jumping.
If he is unsteady, the motion of the horse as he rises
to make his leap is liable to pitch him over his head. On
the other hand, if he clings back, a dead weight in his
saddle, he is liable to throw the horse backward. I have
seen both done. The secret of successful jumping is to
give the horse his head as he rises, feel your knees against
his sides firmly, rising with him as he rises and be again
in your seat before his feet reach the ground. This
helps him and saves both a killing jounce. I finally trained
him so that as a jumper he was without a peer in our
part of the army. I have had the men hold a pole fully
a foot higher than my head, as I stood on the ground, and
have jumped him back and forth over it as readily as cats
and dogs are taught to jump over one's arm. And the
men insisted that he cleared the pole at least a foot each
jump.</p>

<p>This jumping of horses was considered quite an accomplishment
in the army, it being often a necessity on the
march in getting over obstacles. One day I saw our
general's son, a young West Pointer, attached to his
father's staff, trying to force his Kentucky thoroughbred
to jump a creek that ran past division head-quarters. The
creek was probably ten to twelve feet wide and, like all
Virginia creeks, its banks seemed cut vertically through
the soil and the water at the edges was about a foot deep.
After repeated trials the best the young man's horse could
do was to get his forefeet on the opposite bank. His
hindfeet always landed in the water. Mr. West Pointer
was way above noticing in any way a poor volunteer
plebeian like myself mounted on an old plug like Don.
But Don had taken in the situation as well as I, and when
I said, "Come, Don, let's us try it," he just gathered
himself and sailed over that creek like a bird, landing
easily a couple of feet on the other side, and swung around
for another try. The young fellow gathered up his thoroughbred
and with an oath of disgust retired. Don and
I became great friends, and after our fight, above mentioned,
in all our practice jumping or on the march, or
riding about, I never had occasion to use the spur,&mdash;indeed,
I seldom wore one. A simple "Come, Don," and
he was quick to obey my every wish. He was kind and
tractable with others, but it was a singular fact that, as for
jumping or any other favors, he would do nothing for
anybody but me, not even for my man who took care of
him. Others, including horse-trainers, repeatedly asked
to try him, thinking they could improve his work, but
he drew the line on all; not even a little jump would
he make for any of them. I had been jumping him, one
day, to the delight and admiration of the men. Among
them was a horse-trainer of the Fourth New York, who
asked the privilege of trying him. He mounted and
brought him cantering up to the pole as though he was
going over all right, but instead of making the leap he
suddenly whirled, almost dumping the trainer, to the infinite
amusement of the men; nor could he induce him
to make the leap. I mounted again and he went over,
back and forth, without the slightest hesitation. I brought
him home from the war, and it was a great grief to me
that I was unable to keep him as long as he lived. I
secured him a good home, where he lived to a dignified
old age. One of my household gods is a photograph of
Don and myself, with a section of the camp of Hancock's
division of the Second Corps for a background, taken at
this time, whilst we lay back of Falmouth.</p>

<p>My second adventure that first day on picket duty
occurred shortly after I reached the head-quarters of the
picket at the Lacey House, directly opposite the city
of Fredericksburg. I had seen the new line posted and
the old line relieved, when a grizzly bearded old gentleman
rode up and inquired for the "Officer of the day."
His dress was exceedingly plain. He wore a much-battered
slouch hat down over his eyes, and on the shoulders
of his blouse, scarcely discernible, was what had been the
silver stars of a brigadier-general. I answered his inquiry
by saluting, and then recognized General Alfred Sully,
long famed as an Indian fighter before the war. He introduced
himself as "Corps officer of the day" and my
superior officer for this tour of picket duty. The peculiar
thing about his presence was his treatment of me. He
evidently saw that he had a greenhorn on hand, for the
first question he fired at me was, "How many times have
you served as picket officer of the day?" I candidly replied
that this was my first experience. "Your knowledge
of the duties of officer of the day is somewhat
limited?" I admitted the fact. "That is all right," said
he with a pleasant smile. "You are just the man I want.
You shall remain with me all day, and I will teach you
all there is about it." I shall never forget that day's
experience with this splendid old officer. I rode with
him over the whole corps line in the morning, and after
that he made his head-quarters at the Lacey House with
me. Our division front, said he, is where an attack is
most to be looked for, and then he went over it carefully
with me, pointing out the most probable points of attack
and how they should be met; what to do at this point
and that, and so on, in a most intelligent and entertaining
manner gave me the practical idea of a picket defence,
out of his long and ample experience as a regular army
officer. It was just what I needed and was of the greatest
value to me. It was practical experience under a superb
instructor. If all the regular army officers I came in
contact with had been as kind and considerate as this
superb Indian fighter, I should have been equally grateful.
Unfortunately, this was not the case. My experience in
this respect may have been exceptional, but the instance
above narrated is the one solitary case in which my duties
brought me in contact with regular army officers that I
did not receive a rebuff, frequently most brutal and insulting.
Doubtless the lack of knowledge of army customs
and routine on the part of us volunteer officers was
calculated to try their patience, for they occupied all the
higher executive staff positions, and routine business of
all kinds had to pass their scrutiny.</p>

<p>But what were they given West Point education and
training at the public expense for if not to impart it to
those who should be called to fill volunteer positions in
times of the country's need? And how should a volunteer,
called into the service of his country without a particle
of military education, be expected to understand the
interminable routine of army red tape? I will dismiss
this digression with a single instance of my experience in
seeking information from one of the younger West Pointers.
It occurred while I was still adjutant and shortly
before my promotion. Some special detailed report was
called for. There were so many of these wanted, with
so many minute and intricate details, that I cannot remember
what this particular one was, but they were
enough almost to drive a man to drink. This one, I
remember, utterly stumped me, and I rode over to Captain
Mason, assistant adjutant-general of our brigade, a thoroughly
competent officer, for information. He looked at
it a moment, then said: "It beats me; but go down to
corps head-quarters and you will find Lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;,
a regular army officer, whose business it is to give just
such information as you require." I rode there at once
and inquired for Lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;, as directed. The
reply was, "Here he is. What in h&mdash;l do you want?"
Not specially reassured by this inquiry, I handed him
the paper and made known my wishes for information.
He literally threw it back at me with the reply, "Go to
h&mdash;l and find out." I replied that from his manner of
speech I appeared to be pretty near there now. I went
back to Captain Mason and recounted my experience, to
his intense disgust, but that was all that ever came of it.
We volunteers learned to avoid a regular officer, especially
of the young West Point type, as we would a
pestilence.</p>

<p>Returning now to my picket duties of that day, a third
incident occurred in the afternoon. The captain of the
picket came into our office at the Lacey House with the
information that there was a hail from the opposite bank
of the river with a flag of truce&mdash;a small white flag. We
all rushed out, and General Sully directed the captain to
take a corporal's guard&mdash;a corporal and four men&mdash;from
his reserve, and go down to the water's edge under a like
flag and inquire what was wanted. This formality, he
said, was necessary to properly recognize their flag of
truce, and to guard against a possible fake or bit of
treachery. The reply from the other side was that a
young woman in Fredericksburg was exceedingly desirous
of reaching her home some distance within the
Union lines, and would the Union commander receive a
communication upon the subject. General Sully replied
that he would receive their communication and forward
it to head-quarters, whereupon an orderly was sent over
in a boat with the communication. He was unarmed, as
were those who rowed him over. The letter was despatched
to army head-quarters, whilst the orderly and his
boatmen were detained at the landing under guard of our
detail. They sat down and in an entirely easy and friendly
way chatted with our guard. One would not have
believed that these men would shed each other's blood
instantly the little white flag was lowered. Yet such was
the fact. A half-hour brought a reply to the communication.
We, of course, saw neither their letter nor the
reply, but my lady was immediately brought over and
escorted by a mounted guard to army head-quarters, an
ambulance being utilized for the purpose. She was really
a very pretty young woman, and evidently a thorough
lady, though a spirit of hauteur made it apparent she was
a Southerner through and through. She maintained a
perfect composure during the formality of her reception
into our lines, for the officer from the rebel lines who
escorted her required a receipt from the officer who had
been sent down from head-quarters to receive her; and
the appearance of a pretty woman in our lines was so
unusual an event that Uncle Sam's boys may have been
pardoned if they were all anxious to get a square view of
the charming vision. This receipt had to be made in
duplicate, one for each army, both officers, as well as the
young woman, attesting it with their signatures. General
Sully more than half suspected she was a rebel spy. If
she was, they wisely chose a beauty for the work.</p>

<p>D<span class="smcap">uring</span> the remainder of the winter at Falmouth, I was
on as field-officer of the day about every fifth day, so that
I was much of the time at the Lacey House, and on
the picket-line described in the foregoing chapter. The
scenes here enacted constituted my chief experience at
this time. The Lacey House was famous during the war
as being the head-quarters of either the picket lines
between the two armies or of commanding officers of
portions of both so frequently that it deserves more than
a passing notice. It was a large old-time brick mansion,
beautifully situated on the bank of the Rappahannock,
just opposite Fredericksburg, and was, at the outbreak of
the war, the private residence of Colonel Lacey, who was
at the time I write a colonel in the rebel army. The house
was very large; its rooms almost palatial in size, had
been finished in richly carved hardwood panels and wainscoting,
mostly polished mahogany. They were now
denuded of nearly all such elegant wood-work. The
latter, with much of the carved furniture, had been appropriated
for fire-wood. Pretty expensive fuel? Yes, but
not nearly so expensive as the discomfort of staying there
without a fire, with the temperature just above the
freezing-point, and your feet and body wet through from
the rain and slush of the storm outside, in which you were
doing picket duty. The only other fuel obtainable was a
few soggy green logs; whether these had been cut from
the old shade trees surrounding its ample grounds or not
I do not know. I more than suspect they had, but the
only way they could be made to burn in the old-fashioned
open fireplaces was to assist the flames with an occasional
piece of dry wood, the supply of which, as long as it
lasted, was from the panels, wainscoting, and furniture
of the house. Later on the interior doors, all of heavy,
elegant hardwood and finished in keeping with the other
appointments of the place, had to go. This may seem at
this distance as vandalism pure and simple. But if the
would-be critic will place himself in the shoes of the
soldier doing picket duty that winter, with all its hardships,
and then remember that Colonel Lacey, the owner
of the place, was not only in active rebellion against the
government we were fighting to maintain, but was a
colonel commanding a rebel regiment as a part of that
great rebel army encamped not a rifle-shot away, which
made it necessary for us to do this picket duty, he may
reach the same conclusion as did our men, that it was not
worth while to freeze ourselves in order to preserve this
rebel's property. The large and ample grounds had been
laid out with all the artistic care a landscape gardener
could bestow upon them. Rare plants, shrubs, and trees
from all over the world had been transplanted here in
great variety. They were now feeling the bitter blight
of war. Army wagons and artillery had made sad havoc
of the beautiful grounds, and such of the rare trees and
shrubbery as interfered with a good vision of the operations
of the rebels in and around Fredericksburg had
been ruthlessly removed, and this included the larger part
of them.</p>

<p>The Christian Commission had its head-quarters in one
wing of the house during this winter. It was presided
over by Mrs. John Harris, of Philadelphia, a most benevolent
and amiable elderly lady. She was assisted by two
or three young women, among whom was a daughter of
Justice Grier, of the United States Supreme Court. These
ladies were engaged in distributing supplies of various
kinds, furnished by this association, to the sick and
wounded soldiers in the various hospitals. They had an
ambulance at their disposal, and one or two orderlies
detailed to assist them. Their work was most gracious
and helpful, and they were entitled to the greatest credit
for their hard and self-sacrificing labors. The red flag of
the hospital floated over them, and such protection as it
afforded they had; but it may be well understood that this
location between two hostile armies, with active hostilities
likely to be resumed any moment, and in the midst of a
picket force keenly on the alert night and day, was not
likely to be selected as a sanitarium for cases of nervous
prostration. The men on picket had reason to remember
Mrs. Harris, for those located at the Lacey House daily
partook of her bounty in the way of hot coffee, and frequently
a dish of good hot soup; and the officers stationed
there, usually three or four, were regularly invited to her
table for all meals. These invitations were sure to be
accepted, for they afforded an opportunity for a partially
civilized meal. Her meals were always preceded by a
"grace" said by herself, while breakfast was followed by
a worship service, at which a chapter from the Bible was
read and prayer offered by her. These prayers I shall
never forget&mdash;their sweet fervency, in which the soldiers
came in for a large share of her earnest requests. This
large-hearted, motherly little woman made a host of
friends among the boys in blue that winter. But her
motherly kindness was occasionally taken advantage of
by some of those sons of Belial. One of them told this
story of his former tour of duty: The weather was beastly
uncomfortable, from rain and snow making a slush and
mud, through which they had tramped until thoroughly
soaked. They concluded they must have some hot whiskey
punch. Mother Harris, they knew, had all the necessary
ingredients, but how to get them was the question.
One of them feigned a sudden attack of colic, and was
all doubled up on the floor, groaning piteously. Mother
Harris was told of it. Of course, she rushed in to render
assistance. In reply to her inquiries, the rascal could
think of but one thing that would help him, and that was
whiskey. A bottle was instantly produced, and a dose
administered which gave partial relief; and now if he
only had some hot water he was sure it would relieve him.
A pitcher of steaming hot water was immediately sent in.
Then it was found that the strong liquor nauseated him,
and one of the other scamps suggested that perhaps a
lemon would relieve that, and a nice lemon was instantly
produced. They had plenty of sugar themselves, and so
from good Mother Harris's benevolent provision for the
colic these rascals deliberately brewed a pitcher full of
excellent hot whiskey punch. They had to invent a number
of additional lies to keep her out of the room, but
they were equal to it. She sent her orderlies in, one after
the other, to inquire how the patient was progressing,
and the boys secured a proper message back by letting
them in for a swig. I hope the good old lady never discovered
the fraud. I am sure she would not have believed
anybody who might have undertaken to enlighten her,
for her confidence in her "boys in blue" was so
unbounded.</p>

<p>Almost every tour of picket duty revealed some new
incident. Our pickets were now posted in full view of
those of the enemy, and the river was so narrow that conversation
between the pickets could be carried on without
difficulty. Peremptory orders were issued forbidding our
pickets from replying, or in any manner communicating
with them, but it required the greatest care and vigilance
on the part of all the officers of the picket to enforce this
order. One of their sentries would hail one of ours with
some friendly remark, and it was difficult to suppress the
desire to reply. If a reply was not forthcoming, a nagging
ejaculation, calculated to provoke, would follow, such as,
"What's the matter, Yank, are ye deaf?" "Maybe ye
are afeared o' those d&mdash;d officers." "We 'uns don't give
a d&mdash;for our officers," and so volley after volley would
follow, whilst poor Yank had to continue silently walking
his beat. Sometimes the "Johnny" would wind up with
a blast of oaths at his silent auditor. Frequently our men
would reply if they thought no officer was near to hear;
they seemed to feel that it was only decent to be courteous
to them. Strange as it may seem, there was a strong
disposition to fraternize whenever opportunity offered on
the part of the men of both sides. This was manifested
daily on this picket-line, not only in talk across the river,
but in communication by means of miniature boats. Our
men were generally short of tobacco, and the Johnnies
had an abundance of this article of the very best quality;
on the other hand, our men were "long" on coffee, of
which commodity they were "short." So "Johnny"
would fix up a trade. "Say, Yank, if I send you over
a boat-load of 'backy,' will ye send her back filled with
coffee?" If he got an affirmative reply, which he often
did, he would place his little boat in the stream with its
rudder so fastened that the current would shoot it across
a hundred yards or so further down. Yank would watch
his opportunity, get the boat, take out its precious cargo
of tobacco, reload it with coffee, reverse the rudder, and
send it back to "Johnny," who was watching for it further
down the stream. Newspapers soon were called for by
"Johnny," and became a regular part of the cargo of
these boats, for the rebels were wild to get our papers.
The exchange of coffee and tobacco was a comparatively
harmless matter and would probably have been winked
at, but the sending of our Northern papers into their line,
containing news of every movement of our forces, was
a thing that must be prohibited. A large part of the
special instructions of all picket officers related to the
suppression of this traffic. Scarcely a day passed that we
did not confiscate one or more of these boats. The
tobacco our men were allowed to take, but the boat and
all rebel newspapers had to be sent to army head-quarters.
Some of these miniature boats were marvels of beauty,
and showed mechanical skill in construction of the highest
order. Others were rude "dugouts." They were generally
about thirty inches long, six to ten inches wide,
and about six inches deep. They were therefore capable
of holding quite a quantity. It was a traffic very difficult
to suppress, for our men wanted the tobacco and were
unwilling to take that without sending back the proper
<i>quid pro quo</i>. I doubt if it was ever altogether stopped
that winter. The desire for tobacco on the part of our
men was so great that they would break over, and some
of the subordinate officers participated in it. These exchanges
generally took place in the very early dawn, when
the officer of the day and the officers of the picket were
not supposed to be around. The officer of the day was
required to make the "rounds" of his picket-line once
after midnight, and then if everything was all right he
could rest, his officers of the picket being responsible to
him for their respective sections of the line. What is
known in army regulations as the "grand rounds," a
ceremonial visiting of the line by the officer of the day,
accompanied by a sergeant and detail, was omitted on
the picket-line as too noisy and ostentatious. In its place
the officer of the day went over his line as quietly as
possible, assuring himself that each man was in his proper
place and was alert and doing his duty.</p>

<p>The sleepy time was from two o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> until daylight,
and this was the time I found it necessary to be on
the line. It took from two to four hours to get over the
entire line and visit every sentry. The line, as I have
stated heretofore, extended from the railroad bridge at
Fredericksburg to the village of Falmouth, a distance of
two and a half to three miles. In the daytime I could
ride over it comfortably, but in the night I had to take it
on foot. When these were dark as ink, and rainy, and
the ground was slushy and muddy, as it usually was at
that time, it was not a very agreeable duty. However,
my duty was so much lighter than that of the men (who,
though they were only two hours on post at a time,
were out in the storm all the while), that I could not
complain. The fidelity of our men to duty under these
trying circumstances was most remarkable. Twice only
that winter did I find a man sleeping on post. In both of
these cases the delinquent was scarcely more than a boy,
who I really believed told the truth when they said they
sat down because unable to stand up any longer, and, of
course, instantly fell asleep. I had them relieved and
sent back to camp, and did not report their offence.</p>

<p>A disagreeable duty I had to perform occurred one
morning just at break of day. I had just returned from
my trip over the line and was about entering the Lacey
House, when I noticed a man running down towards the
water's edge on the other side of the river. On these
night tours of duty I wore a large cavalry overcoat with
a long cape, which thoroughly concealed my rank and
sword. I stepped out to the top of the bank to see what
this man was doing, and he hailed me with: "Hello,
Yank. I am going to send ye over a nice boat, with
tobacco and newspapers. Look out and get her, and
send her back with coffee and newspapers, and don't let
any of your d&mdash;d officers get hold of it. If they catch
ye they'll raise h&mdash;l with you, and swipe the whole business."
I did not say a word, but quietly walked down to
where I saw the boat would touch the shore and waited
for it. In the mean time he kept up a running fire of
admonitions like the above, chiefly directed to the need
of watching against the vigilance of our d&mdash;d officers.
I picked up the boat, took it up the bank, and then threw
my coat open, disclosing my sword and my sash as officer
of the day. Oh! the profanity and billingsgate that followed
beggars description. I thought I had heard swearing
before, but never anything to touch this fellow, and
I really could not blame him very much. He had simply
hailed the wrong man. The man he thought he was
hailing, seeing my presence, kept out of the way. The
boat was a little beauty, one of the handsomest I ever
saw. It contained five or six pounds of the best Virginia
plug tobacco and several newspapers from Richmond. I
would have been glad to have kept the boat as a souvenir,
but had to despatch it to head-quarters with all its contents
at once. Of course I never saw it again.</p>

<p>The "Johnnies" were not without their fun, as well as
our boys. Several times I was saluted by their pickets
as officer of the day. Army regulations require the sentry
nearest the picket reserve, on seeing the officer of the day
approach, to call out, "Turn out the guard, officer of the
day." Thereupon the officer of the picket parades his
reserves, which presents arms and is then inspected by
the officer of the day. The red sash worn crosswise over
the shoulder is the insignia of the officer of the day.
Several times that winter, as I was riding along our line,
a rebel sentry yelled, "Turn out the guard, officer of the
day," and a sergeant paraded his guard, faced towards me
across the river, and presented arms. Of course, I lifted
my cap in acknowledgment of the compliment, even
though it was a bit of deviltry on their part. This indicated
a grave want of discipline on the part of their troops.
I am sure such an act would not have been thought of by
our men.</p>

<p>General Burnside was relieved from command of the
army on the 26th of January, 1863, and was succeeded
by Major-General Joseph Hooker. "Fighting Joe," as
he was familiarly called, was justly popular with the army,
nevertheless there was general regret at the retirement
of Burnside, notwithstanding his ill success. That there
was more than the "fates" against him was felt by many,
and whether under existing conditions "Fighting Joe"
or any one else was likely to achieve any better success
was a serious question. However, all felt that the new
commander had lots of fight in him, and the old Army
of the Potomac was never known to "go back" on such
a man. His advent as commander was signalized by a
modest order announcing the fact, and matters moved
on without a ripple upon the surface. Routine work,
drills, and picket duty occupied all our time. Some of
our men were required to go on picket duty every other
day, so many were off duty from sickness and other
causes. Twenty-four hours on picket duty, with only
twenty-four hours off between, was certainly very severe
duty, yet the men did it without a murmur. When it is
understood that this duty required being that whole time
out in the most trying weather, usually either rain, sleet,
slush, or mud, and constantly awake and alert against
a possible attack, one can form an idea of the strain upon
physical endurance it involved.</p>

<p>The chief event preceding the Chancellorsville movement
was the grand review of the army by President Lincoln
and staff. The exact date of this review I do not
remember, but it occurred a short time before the movement
upon Chancellorsville. Owing to the absence of
Colonel Albright and the illness of Lieutenant-Colonel
Shreve, the command of the regiment devolved upon me,
and I had a funny experience getting ready for it. As a
sort of preliminary drill, I concluded I would put the
regiment through a practice review on our drill grounds.
To do this properly, I had to imagine the presence of a
reviewing officer standing before our line at the proper
distance of thirty to forty yards. The ceremony involved
opening the ranks, which brought the officers to the front
of the line, the presenting arms, and dipping the colors,
which the reviewing officer, usually a general, acknowledged
by lifting his hat and gracefully bowing. I had
reached the point in my practice drill where the "present
arms" had been executed, and the colors lowered, and
had turned to the front myself to complete the ceremony
by presenting sword to my imaginary general, when lo!
there rose up in front of me, in the proper position, a real
reviewing officer in the shape of one of the worst looking
army "bums" I ever saw. He assumed the position and
dignified carriage of a major-general, lifted his dirty old
"cabbage-leaf" cap, and bowed up and down the line with
the grace and air of a Wellington, and then he promptly
skedaddled. The "boys" caught the situation instantly
and were bursting with laughter. Of course I didn't
notice the performance, but the effort not to notice it
almost used me up. This will illustrate how the army
"bummer" never let an opportunity slip for a practical
joke, cost what it might. This fellow was a specimen of
this genus that was ubiquitous in the army. Every regiment
had one or more. They were always dirty and
lousy, a sort of tramp, but always on hand at the wrong
time and in the wrong place. A little indifferent sort of
service could be occasionally worked out of them, but
they generally skulked whenever there was business on
hand, and then they were so fertile of excuses that somehow
they escaped the penalty and turned up again when
the "business" was over. Their one specialty was foraging.
They were born foragers. What they could not
steal was not to be had, and this probably accounts in a
measure for their being endured. Their normal occupation
was foraging and, incidentally, Sancho Panza like,
looking for adventure. They knew more of our movements,
and also of those of the enemy, than the commanding
general of either. One of the most typical of this
class that I knew was a young fellow I had known very
well before the war. He was a shining light in society,
occupying a high and responsible business position. His
one fault was his good-fellowship and disposition to be
convivial when off duty. He enlisted among the first,
when the war broke out in 1861, and I did not see him
again until one day one of this genus "bummer" strayed
into our camp. He stuck his head into my tent and
wanted to know how "Fred Hitchcock was." I had to
take a long second look to dig out from this bunch of
rags and filth my one-time Beau Brummel acquaintance
at home. His eyes were bleared, and told all too surely
the cause of the transformation. His brag was that he
had skipped every fight since he enlisted. "It's lots more
fun," he said, "to climb a tree well in the rear and see
the show. It's perfectly safe, you know, and then you
don't get yourself killed and planted. What is the use,"
he argued, "of getting killed and have a fine monument
erected over you, when you can't see it nor make any use
of it after it is done? Let the other fellows do that if
they want to. I've no use for monuments." Poor fellow,
his cynical ideas were his ruin. Better a thousand times
had he been "planted" at the front, manfully doing his
duty, than to save a worthless life and return with the
record of a poltroon, despised by himself and everybody
else.</p>

<p>This review by President Lincoln and the new commander-in-chief,
General Hooker, was, from a military,
spectacular point of view, the chief event of our army
experience. It included the whole of the great Army of
the Potomac, now numbering upward of one hundred
and thirty thousand men, probably its greatest numerical
strength of the whole war. Deducting picket details,
there were present on this review, it is safe to say, from
ninety thousand to one hundred thousand men. It was
a remarkable event historically, because so far as I can
learn it was the only time this great army was ever
paraded in line so that it could be seen all together. In
this respect it was the most magnificent military pageant
ever witnessed on this continent, far exceeding in its
impressive grandeur what has passed into history as the
"great review," which preceded the final "muster out"
at the close of the war in the city of Washington. At the
latter not more than ten thousand men could have been
seen at one time, probably not nearly so many, for the eye
could take in only the column which filled Pennsylvania
Avenue from the Capitol to the Treasury Building.
Whereas, upon our review the army was first drawn up
in what is known as three lines of "masses," and one
glance of the eye could take in the whole army. Think
of it! One hundred thousand men in one sweep of vision!
If the word "Selah" in the Psalm means "stop! think!
consider!" it would be particularly appropriate here.</p>

<p>A word now about the formation in "lines of masses."
Each regiment was formed in column of divisions. To
those unfamiliar with military terms, I must explain that
this very common formation with large bodies of troops
consists in putting two companies together as a division
under the command of the senior officer, thus making
of a regiment of ten companies a column of five divisions,
each two-company front. This was known as "massing"
the troops. When so placed in line they were called a
line of "masses;" when marching, a column of "masses."
It will be seen that the actual frontage of each regiment
so formed was the width of two companies only, the other
eight companies being formed in like manner in their
rear. Now imagine four regiments so formed and placed
side by side, fronting on the same line and separated from
each other by say fifty feet, and you have a brigade line
of masses. The actual frontage of a brigade so formed
would be considerably less than that of a single regiment
on dress parade. Now take three such brigades, separated
from each other by say fifty feet, and you have a
division line of masses. Three divisions made up an
army corps. The army was formed in three lines of
masses, of two corps each, on the large open plain opposite
Fredericksburg, to the south and east of where the railroad
crossed the river. Each of these lines of masses
contained from seventy to eighty regiments of infantry,
besides the artillery, which was paraded on the several
lines at different intervals. I do not remember seeing
any cavalry, and my impression is that this branch of the
service was not represented. Some idea may be formed
of the magnificence of this spectacle when I state that
each of these lines of masses was more than a mile in
length, and the depth of the three lines from front to rear,
including the spaces between, was not less than four hundred
yards, or about one-fifth of a mile. Each of the
regiments displayed its two stands of silk colors, one the
blue flag representing the State from which it came, the
other the national colors. There were here and there a
brace of these flags, very conspicuous in their brilliant
newness, indicating a fresh accession to the army, but
most of them were tattered and torn by shot and shell,
whilst a closer look revealed the less conspicuous but
more deadly slits and punctures of the minie-balls.</p>

<p>Now place yourself on the right of this army paraded
for review and look down the long lines. Try to count
the standards as the favoring wind lifts their sacred folds
and caressingly shows you their battle scars. You will
need to look very closely, lest those miniature penants, far
away, whose staffs appear no larger than parlor matches
protruding above lines of men, whose forms in the distance
have long since merged into a mere bluish gray line,
escape your eye. Your numbering will crowd the five
hundred mark ere you finish, and you should remember
that each of these units represented a thousand men when
in the vigor and enthusiasm of patriotic manhood they
bravely marched to the front. Only a fifth of them left?
you say. And the others? Ah! the battle, the hospital,
the prison-pen, the h-ll of war, must be the answer.</p>

<p>How can words describe the scene? This is that magnificent
old battered Army of the Potomac. Look upon
it; you shall never behold its like again. There have
been and may yet be many armies greater in numbers,
and possibly, in all the paraphernalia of war, more showy.
There can never be another Army of the Potomac, with
such a history. As I gazed up and down those massive
lines of living men, felt that I was one of them, and saw
those battle-scarred flags kissed by the loving breeze, my
blood tingled to my very finger-tips, my hair seemed
almost to raise straight up, and I said a thousand Confederacies
can't whip us. And here I think I grasped the
main purpose of this review. It was not simply to give
the President a sight of his "strong right arm," as he
fondly called the Army of the Potomac, nor General
Hooker, its new commander, an opportunity to see his
men and them a chance to see their new chief,&mdash;though
both of these were included,&mdash;but it was to give the army
a square look at its mighty self, see how large and how
strong it really was, that every man might thereby get
the same enthusiasm and inspiration that I did, and know
that it simply could not be beaten. The enemy, it is not
strange to say, were intensely interested spectators of this
whole scene, for the review was held in full view of the
whole of their army. No place could have been chosen
that would better have accommodated their enjoyment of
the picture, if such it was, than that open plain, exactly in
their front. And we could see them swarming over
Marye's Heights and the lines to the south of it, intently
gazing upon us. A scene more resplendent with military
pageantry and the soul-stirring accessories of war they
will never see again. But did it stir their blood? Yes;
but with bitterness only, for they must have seen that the
task before them of successfully resisting the onslaughts
of this army was impossible. Here was disclosed, undoubtedly,
another purpose of this grand review, viz., to
let the enemy see with their own eyes how powerful the
army was with which they had to contend.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of this review was the marvellous
celerity of its formation. The various corps and subdivisions
of the army were started on the march for the
reviewing ground so as to reach it at about the same time.
It should be remembered that most of them were encamped
from four to eight miles away. Aides-de-camp
with markers by the score were already in position on the
plain when the troops arrived, so that there was almost
no delay in getting into position. As our column debouched
upon the field, there seemed an inextricable mass
of marching columns as far as the eye could see. Could
order ever be gotten out of it? Yet, presto! the right
of the line fell into position, a series of blue blocks, and
then on down to the far left, block after block, came upon
the line with unerring order and precision, as though it
were a long curling whiplash straightening itself out to
the tension of a giant hand. And so with each of the
other two lines. All were formed simultaneously. Here
was not only perfection of military evolution, but the
poetry of rhythmic movement. The three lines were all
formed within twenty minutes, ready for the reviewing
officers.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the blare of the trumpets announced
the approach of the latter, and the tall form of
the President was seen, accompanied by a large retinue,
galloping down the first line. Our division was formed,
as I recollect, in the first line, about three hundred yards
from the right. The President was mounted on a large,
handsome horse, and as he drew near I saw that immediately
on his right rode his son, Robert Lincoln, then a
bright-looking lad of fourteen to fifteen years, and little
"Tad" Lincoln, the idol of his father, was on his left.
The latter could not have been more than seven or eight
years old. He was mounted on a large horse, and his little
feet seemed to stick almost straight out from the saddle.
He was round and pudgy, and his jolly little body bobbed
up and down like a ball under the stiff canter of his horse.
I wondered how he maintained his seat, but he was really
a better horseman than his father, for just before reaching
our regiment there was a little summer stream ravine,
probably a couple of yards wide, that had to be jumped.
The horses took it all right, but the President landed
on the other side with a terrific jounce, being almost unseated.
The boys went over flying, little "Tad" in high
glee, like a monkey on a mustang.</p>

<p>Of course, a mighty cheer greeted the President as he
galloped down the long line. There was something indescribably
weird about that huzzah from the throats of
these thousands of men, first full, sonorous, and thrilling,
and then as it rolled down that attenuated line gradually
fading into a minor strain until it was lost in the distance,
only to reappear as the cavalcade returned in front
of the second line, first the faintest note of a violin, then
rapidly swelling into the full volume, to again die away
and for the third time reappear and die away as the third
line was reviewed. The President was followed by a
large staff dressed in full uniform, which contrasted
strongly with his own severely plain black. He wore a
high silk hat and a plain frock coat. His face wore that
peculiar sombre expression we see in all his photographs,
but it lighted up into a half-smile as he occasionally
lifted his hat in acknowledgment of the cheering of
the men.</p>

<p>About one hundred yards in rear of the President's
staff came the new commanding general, "Fighting Joe."
He was dressed in the full uniform of a major-general,
and was accompanied by his chief of staff, Seth Williams&mdash;he
who had held this position under every commander
of the Army of the Potomac thus far&mdash;and a large and
brilliant staff. There must have been fully twenty officers
of various ranks, from his chief of staff, a general, down
through all grades to a lieutenant, in this corps of staff
officers. It was the first time I had seen General Hooker
to know him. His personal appearance did not belie his
reputation. He had a singularly strong, handsome face,
sat his superb horse like a king, broad-shouldered and
elegantly proportioned in form, with a large, fine head,
well covered with rather long hair, now as white as the
driven snow and flowing in the wind as he galloped down
the line, chapeau in hand; he was a striking and picturesque
figure. It was evident the head of the army had
lost nothing in personal appearance by its recent change.
The same cheering marked the appearance of "Fighting
Joe" which had greeted the President, as he and staff
galloped down and up and down through the three long
lines.</p>

<p>Both reviewing cavalcades moved at a brisk gallop, and
occupied only about twenty minutes covering the three
miles of lines; and then the President and staff took
position, for the marching review, some distance in front
and about midway of the lines. Instantly the scene was
transformed. The first line wheeled into column by
brigades successively and, headed by General Hooker and
staff, moved rapidly forward. There were but few bands,
and the drum corps had been consolidated into division
corps. On passing the President, General Hooker took
position by his side and remained throughout the remainder
of the ceremony. The troops marched in columns
of masses, in the same formation they had stood in
line; that is, in column of two companies front and only
six yards between divisions. This made a very compact
mass of troops, quite unusual in reviews, but was necessary
in order to avoid the great length of time that in the
usual formation would have been required for the passing
of this vast body of men. Yet in this close formation the
balance of the day was nearly consumed in marching past
the President.</p>

<p>It must have been a trying ordeal to him, as he had to
lift his hat as each stand of colors successively dipped in
passing. Immediately on passing the President, the several
brigades were wheeled out of the column and ordered
to quarters. I remember that we returned to our camp,
over a mile distant, dismissed the men, and then several
of us officers rode back to see the continuation of the
pageant. When we got back the second line was only
well on its way, which meant that only about half the
army had passed in review. We could see from fifteen to
twenty thousand men in column&mdash;that is to say, about
one army corps&mdash;at a time. The quick, vigorous step,
in rhythmical cadence to the music, the fife and drum, the
massive swing, as though every man was actually a part
of every other man; the glistening of bayonets like a
long ribbon of polished steel, interspersed with the stirring
effects of those historic flags, in countless numbers,
made a picture impressive beyond the power of description.
A picture of the ages. How glad I am to have
looked upon it. I could not remain to see the end. When
finally I was compelled to leave the third line was marching.
I can still see that soul-thrilling column, that massive
swing, those flaunting colors, that sheen of burnished
steel! Majestic! Incomparable!! Glorious!!!</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE</p>


<p>A<span class="smcap">n</span> interesting item in the experience that winter at
Falmouth was the celebration of St. Patrick's day by the
Irish brigade and their multitude of friends. They were
encamped about a mile to the south of our brigade upon
a beautiful, broad, open plain between the surrounding
hills, which gave them a superb parade and drill-ground.
Upon this they had laid out a mile race track in excellent
shape, and they had provided almost every conceivable
sort of amusement that was possible to army life&mdash;matches
in running, jumping, boxing, climbing the
greased pole, sack races, etc. But the usual pig performance
had to be omitted owing to the enforced
absence of the pig. The appearance of a live porker
would have stampeded the army in a wild chase for
fresh meat.</p>

</div>

<p>The chief events were horse races. The army abounded
in excellent thoroughbreds, private property of officers,
and all were anxious to show the mettle of their steeds.
Everybody was invited to be present and take such part
as he pleased in any of the events. It was a royal gala
day to the army; from morning until night there were
excitement and side-splitting amusement. Nor was there,
throughout the whole day, a thing, not even a small fight,
that I heard of, to mar the wholesome fun, until towards
night our old enemy, John Barleycorn, managed to get in
some of his work.</p>

<p>The chief event of the day and the wind-up was a
hurdle and ditch race, open to officers only. Hurdles and
ditches alternated the course at a distance of two hundred
yards, except at the finish, where a hurdle and ditch were
together, the ditch behind the hurdle. Such a race was
a hare-brained performance in the highest degree; but
so was army life at its best, and this was not out of keeping
with its surroundings. Excitement was what was
wanted, and this was well calculated to produce it.</p>

<p>The hurdles were four and five feet high and did not
prove serious obstacles to the jumpers, but the ditches,
four and five feet wide and filled with water, proved a
<i>bête noir</i> to most of the racers. Some twenty-five, all
young staff-officers, started, but few got beyond the first
ditch. Many horses that took the hurdle all right positively
refused the ditch. Several officers were dumped
at the first hurdle, and two were thrown squarely over
their horses' heads into the first ditch, and were nice-looking
specimens as they crawled out of that bath of
muddy water. They were unhurt, however, and remounted
and tried it again, with better success.</p>

<p>The crowning incident of the day occurred at the finish
of this race at the combination hurdle and ditch. Out of
the number who started, only three had compassed safely
all the hurdles and ditches and come to the final leap.
The horses were about a length apart each. The first
took the hurdle in good shape, but failed to reach the
further bank of the ditch and fell over sideways into it,
carrying down his rider. Whilst they were struggling to
get out, the second man practically repeated the performance
and fell on the first pair, and the rear man, now
unable to check his horse, spurred him over, only to fall
on the others. It was a fearful sight for a moment, and it
seemed certain that the officers were killed or suffocated
in that water, now thick with mud. But a hundred hands
were instantly to the rescue, and in less time than it takes
to tell it all were gotten out and, strange to say, the horses
were unhurt and only one officer seriously injured, a
broken leg only to the bad for the escapade. But neither
officers nor horses were particularly handsome as they
emerged from that ditch. The incident can be set down
as a terrific finale to this first and last army celebration
of St. Patrick's day.</p>

<p>The tedium of routine duty occupied our time without
specially exciting incident until pleasanter weather
towards the middle of April brought rumors of impending
army movements again. About April 20 we heard
the cavalry under Stoneman were on the move, and this
was confirmed the next day, when I saw that general with
quite a body of cavalry marching leisurely north. The
horses appeared in excellent condition after a winter of
partial rest. General Stoneman was a large man, with
short gray whiskers and gray hair and a strikingly
bronzed red face. This story was told of him anent this
movement, that Hooker had told him to do something
with his horses; to cross the river at one of the fords
above and shake out his cavalry, that it was "about time
the army saw a dead cavalryman." Stoneman had replied,
asking for materials to build bridges with, and "Fighting
Joe" had impatiently replied that he wouldn't "give a
d&mdash;n for a cavalryman who couldn't make a bridge
without materials," meaning who could not cross a river
without a bridge.</p>

<p>Soon orders came to supply ourselves with extra ammunition,
and be prepared to move with six days' rations
at a moment's notice. This settled it that "business"
was about to commence again in earnest. What the contemplated
movement was we had not the remotest idea,
though we knew, of course, it was to be another whack
in some form at the Johnnies on the other side of the
river. We set about disposing of all surplus baggage
which had accumulated for winter quarters, and putting
everything in trim for field living once more. We could
now see columns of troops in the distance marching north.
Was the new movement, then, to be in that direction?
This was the topic upon all lips. The desire to know
something of what was being done with us was naturally
very strong. Where were we going? What were we
going to do? Yet a desire that in the nature of things
could not be satisfied. One can have no conception of
the feeling of going day after day blindly ahead, not
knowing whither or why; knowing only that sooner or
later you are going to fetch up against a fight, and calculating
from your surroundings the probabilities of
when.</p>

<p>We felt one satisfaction, however, that this was to be
our last campaign as a regiment. Most of our men had
enlisted in the July previous for nine months, and their
time was now practically out; but, to their credit be it
said, they would not raise this question during an active
movement. There were troops who threw down their
arms on the eve of battle and refused to go into action
because their time was out. Such action has been severely
criticised, and I think uncharitably. After a man has
honorably and patriotically served his full time and is
entitled to his discharge, it would seem pretty hard to
force him to go into battle and be killed or wounded.
Nevertheless, as a matter of fact, nearly this whole campaign
was overtime for most of our regiment, yet the
question was not raised.</p>

<p>On April 28 our corps broke camp and joined the column
northward. The winter's rest had brought some
accessions to our ranks from the sick and wounded,
though the severe picket duty and the excessively damp
weather had given us a large sick list. We had, to start
with, upward of three hundred and seventy-five men, to
which was added some twenty-five or thirty from the
sick list, who came up to us on the march. It is a curious
fact that many men left sick in camp, unable to march
when the regiment leaves, will get themselves together
after the former has been gone a few hours and pull out
to overtake it. I saw men crying like children because
the surgeon had forbidden them going with the regiment.
The loneliness and homesickness, or whatever you
please to call it, after the regiment has gone are too much
for them. They simply cannot endure it, and so they
strike out and follow. They will start by easy marches,
and they generally improve in health from the moment
they start. Courage and nerve are both summoned for
the effort, and the result is that at the end of the second
or third day they rejoin the regiment and report for duty.
This does not mean that they were not really sick, but
that will power and exercise have beaten the disease.
I have heard many a sick man say he would rather die
than be left behind.</p>

<p>We marched about six miles the first day, much of our
route being through a wooded country, some of it so wet
and spongy that corduroy roads had to be built for the
wagons and artillery. The army can, as a rule, move as
rapidly as it can move its artillery and supply trains, and
no faster. Of course, for short distances and special expeditions,
where circumstances require, both cavalry and
infantry move very rapidly, ignoring the wagon trains
and artillery; but on a general campaign this is impossible,
and so where the ground is bad these must be
helped along. In a wooded country the usual method is
by corduroy road. Extra details are made to assist the
pioneer corps, who cut down young saplings three to six
inches in diameter and about six feet in length and lay
them side by side on the ground, which is roughly levelled
to receive them. They do not make a handsome road to
speed over, but they bear up the artillery and army
schooners, and that is all that is wanted of them.</p>

<p>The second day we crossed the Rappahannock at
United States ford on a pontoon bridge. There had
been a sharp skirmish here when the first troops crossed
a couple of days before, and a battery of artillery was still
in position guarding the crossing. We now began to
experience once more the unmistakable symptoms of approaching
battle,&mdash;sharp spurts of cannonading at irregular
intervals some distance to the south and west of us,
with the hurry of marching troops, ambulances and
stretcher corps towards the front; more or less of army
débris scattered about, and the nervous bustle everywhere
apparent. We reached the famous Chancellorsville House
shortly after midnight. This was an old-time hostelry,
situated on what was called the Culpeper plank-road.
It stood with two or three smaller houses in a cleared
square space containing some twenty or thirty acres, in
the midst of the densest forest of trees and undergrowth
I ever saw. We had marched all day on plank and corduroy
roads, through this wild tanglewood forest, most
of the time in a drizzling rain, and we had been much
delayed by the artillery trains, and it was after midnight
when we reached our destination. The distance marched
must have been twelve or more miles, and our men became
greatly fatigued towards the last.</p>

<p>It was my first experience with the regiment on the
march in the field in my new position as major. As
adjutant my place had been with the colonel at the head
of the column. Now my duties required me to march
in the rear and keep up the stragglers. After nightfall it
became intensely dark, and at each rest the men would
drop down just where they were and would be instantly
sound asleep. Whether they dropped down into mud or
not made little difference to many of them, for they were
soaking wet and were so exhausted that they did not care.
My troubles began when the "forward" was sounded, to
arouse these seeming logs and get them on their feet once
more and started. All who were practically exhausted
had drifted to the rear and were on my hands. We had
a provost guard in the rear, whose duty it was to bring
up every man and permit no straggling, but they were
in almost as bad a plight as the rest of the regiment. To
arouse these sleeping men I had occasionally to resort
to a smart blow with the flat of my sword and follow it
up with the most energetic orders and entreaties. An
appeal to their pluck and nerve was generally sufficient,
and they would summon new courage and push manfully
on. My own condition was scarcely better than that of
the men. I rode that night considerable distances between
our halts for rest, sitting bolt upright in my saddle fast
asleep. I had all day alternated with some of the men in
marching whilst they rode, and was not only thoroughly
tired, but wet through. The march was much more trying
to us because of our unseasoned condition owing to
the long winter's exemption from this exercise. Furthermore,
we had been marching towards the firing, and
were under the nervous strain always incident to operations
in the presence of the enemy. Nothing will quicker
exhaust men than the nervous tension occasioned by the
continued firing which indicates the imminence of a battle.</p>

<p>At daylight we were aroused and under arms again.
We found we were at the head-quarters of the army. The
Chancellorsville House, which had been vacated by its
occupants, was used for office purposes, and much of the
open space around it was occupied by the tents of General
Hooker and staff and hospital tents. Of the latter there
were three or four pitched so as to connect with each
other, and over them was flying the yellow flag of the
corps hospital. The First and Third Divisions of our
Second Corps were massed in this Chancellorsville square,
beside Pettit's battery. Our brigade now consisted of
the Fourth New York, First Delaware, and our regiment.
The first named was sent off on some guard duty, which
left Colonel Albright, of our regiment, the senior officer
in command of the brigade. The ominous rattle of musketry
not far away became momentarily more pronounced,
and ambulances and stretcher-carriers were passing
back and forth to the hospitals, carrying wounded
men. The dead body of a regular army captain was soon
brought back from the front, where Sykes's division of
regulars was sharply engaged. I do not know the name
of this captain, but he was a fine-looking young officer.
He had been killed by a minie-ball squarely through his
forehead.</p>

<p>We were marching out the plank-road as they brought
this body in. Passing out of the clearing, the woods and
undergrowth each side the road was so dense that we
could not see into it a half-dozen steps. We had gone
possibly a quarter of a mile when we were overtaken by
a staff-officer, who in whispers ordered us to turn back,
regardless of orders from the front, and get back to the
Chancellorsville House as rapidly as possible, and to do
so absolutely noiselessly; that a heavy force of rebels
were in the woods on both sides of us, and we were in
great danger of being cut to pieces and captured. We
obeyed, and he rapidly worked his way to the front of
the brigade and succeeded very quickly in getting us all
safely out. We formed line near the Chancellorsville
House and were resting on our arms when I noticed
another brigade going down that same road from which
we had just been so hurriedly gotten out. The circumstance
was so strange that I inquired what brigade it was,
and learned that it was Colonel (afterwards Governor)
James A. Beaver's brigade of Hancock's division of our
corps. They had been gone but a short time when the
rebels opened upon them from both sides of the road, and
they were very roughly handled. Colonel Beaver was
soon brought back, supposed mortally wounded. I saw
him as he was brought to the rear. It was said he was
shot through the body. Afterwards, whilst he was governor,
I mentioned the circumstance to him, and asked
how he succeeded in fighting off the last enemy at that
time. He said he then fully believed his wound was mortal.
The bullet had struck him nearly midway of his body
and appeared to have passed through and out of his back,
and he was bleeding freely. He was brought to the hospital,
where the corps surgeon&mdash;his own family physician
at home&mdash;found him, and with an expression of countenance
indicating the gravest fear proceeded to examine his
wound. Suddenly, with a sigh of relief, he exclaimed:
"Colonel, you are all right; the ball has struck a rib and
followed it around and out." It was one of the hundreds
of remarkable freaks performed by those ugly minie-balls
during the war. Why that brigade should have been
allowed to march into that ambuscade, from which we
had so narrowly escaped, I could not understand. It was
one of the early <i>faux pas</i> of that unfortunate comedy,
rather tragedy of errors,&mdash;battle.</p>

<p>In view of the events of the next two days, it will be
interesting to recall the somewhat windy order published
to the army by General Hooker on the morning of the
1st of May, the date of the first day's battle, on which the
events narrated in the last chapter occurred. This is the
order:</p>

<p class="c top5"><span class="smcap">Head-quarters Army of the Potomac,<br />
Camp near Falmouth, Va.</span>, April 30, 1863.</p>

<p class="sml1"
style="border-bottom:dotted 5px gray;padding-bottom:2%;">It is with heartfelt satisfaction the commanding general announces
to the army that the operations of the last three days have determined
that our enemy must either ingloriously fly or come out from
behind his defences and give us battle on our own ground, when
certain destruction awaits him.</p>

<p class="sml1">By command of Major-General Hooker.</p>

<p class="r"><span class="smcap">S. Williams</span>,<br />
<i>Asst. Adjt.-Gen'l.</i></p>

<p class="top5">My recollection recalls a phrase in this order reading
something like this: "We have got the enemy where God
Almighty can't save him, and he must either ingloriously,"
etc. I have been surprised not to find it in the records,
and my memory is not alone in this respect, for a lieutenant-colonel
of Portland, Me., in his account of this battle
alludes to Hooker's blasphemous order.</p>

<p>The purpose of this order was to encourage the men
and inspire them with the enthusiasm of forthcoming victory.
But when we consider that the portion of the army
operating around Chancellorsville was at that very
moment apparently as thoroughly caged up in a wilderness
of almost impenetrable undergrowth, which made it impossible
to move troops, and into which one could not see
a dozen feet, as though they were actually behind iron
bars, it will be seen how little ground there was for
encouragement. I can think of no better comparison of
the situation than to liken it to a fleet of ships enveloped
in a dense fog endeavoring to operate against another
having the advantage of the open.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when this movement commenced
the Army of the Potomac numbered from one
hundred and twenty thousand to one hundred and thirty
thousand men, about double the opposing rebel force.
Hooker divided this army, taking with him four corps,
numbering probably seventy thousand men, to operate
from Chancellorsville towards Fredericksburg, and
leaving three corps, about fifty thousand men, under
Sedgwick, to move upon the latter place from below. The
purpose was to get Lee's army between these two forces
and crush him. All historians of this battle agree that
up to a certain point Hooker's strategy was most admirable.
General Pleasanton, who commanded our cavalry
forces in that action, says that up to a certain point
the movement on Chancellorsville was one of the most
brilliant in the annals of war. He put that point at the
close of Thursday, April 30. He had made a full reconnoissance
of all that country and had informed General
Hooker of the nature of the ground, that for a depth of
from four to five miles it was all unbroken tanglewood
of the densest undergrowth, in which it was impossible to
man&oelig;uvre an army or to know anything of the movements
of the enemy; that beyond this wilderness the
country was open and well adapted to military movements,
and he had taken occasion to urge upon him the importance
of moving forward at once, so as to meet the enemy
in open ground, but his information and advice, he tells
us, fell upon leaden ears.</p>

<p>Lee had, up to this time, no information of the movement
upon Chancellorsville, having been wholly occupied
with Sedgwick at Fredericksburg. The former was
therefore a complete surprise to him. The "golden
moment," according to Pleasanton, to move forward and
carry the battle out into the open, where the army could
have been handled and would have had a chance, was on
that day, as instantly the movement was disclosed, the
enemy, being familiar with every foot of the country,
would detach a sufficient force to operate in the open, and
along the edge of the wilderness could keep us practically
bottled up there and beat us in detail; and that is precisely
what seems to have been done. The inexplicable question
is, Why did fighting "Joe Hooker," with seventy thousand
as good troops as ever fired a gun, sit down in the
middle of that tanglewood forest and allow Lee to make
a monkey of him while Sedgwick was doing such magnificent
work below?</p>

<p>Two distinguished participants in all these events holding
high commands, namely, General Alfred Pleasanton,
quoted above, and General Doubleday, commanding First
Division, First Army Corps, have written articles upon
this battle, agreeing on the feasibility and brilliancy of the
movement, but by inference and things unsaid have practically
left the same question suspended in the air. It is
possible the correct answer should not now be given.</p>

<p>To return to our own doings, on that Friday, 1st of
May, our division was drawn up in line of battle in front
of the Chancellorsville House, and we were permitted to
rest on our arms. This meant that any moment we might
be expected to move forward. The battle was now on in
earnest. Heavy firing was heard some miles below us,
which was Sedgwick's work at Fredericksburg. Nearer
by there was cannonading and more or less severe musketry
firing. Ambulances and stretcher-carriers were constantly
coming back from the front with wounded soldiers,
taking them to the field hospital, which was just in our
rear, and we could see the growing piles of amputated
legs and arms which were thrown outside with as little
care as if they were so many pieces of wood. We were
evidently waiting for something, nobody seemed to know
what. Everything appeared to be "at heads." Our corps
and division commanders, Couch, Hancock, and French,
with their staffs, were in close proximity to the troops,
and all seemed to be in a condition of nervous uncertainty.
What might be progressing in those black woods in front,
was the question. A nearer volley of musketry would
start everybody up, and we would stand arms in hand, as
if expecting the unseen enemy to burst through the woods
upon us. Then the firing would slacken and we would
drop down again for a time.</p>

<p>In the mean time shells were screeching over us continually,
and an occasional bullet would whiz uncomfortably
near. The nervous strain under such conditions
may be imagined. This state of affairs continued all
through Friday night and most of Saturday. Of course,
sleep was out of the question for any of our officers. On
Thursday and Friday nights the men got snatches of
sleep, lying on their arms, between the times all were
aroused against some fresh alarm.</p>

<p>On Saturday some beef cattle were driven up and
slaughtered in the open square in front of our lines, and
the details were progressing with the work of preparing
the meat for issue when the storm of disaster of Saturday
afternoon burst upon us and their work was rudely interrupted.
We had anxious premonitions of this impending
storm for some hours. Captain Pettit, who commanded
the famous battery of that name, which was posted immediately
in our rear, had spent much of his time in the forenoon
of Saturday high up in a tall tree which stood just
in front of the Chancellorsville House and close to our
line, with his field glass reconnoitring. Several times he
had come down with information that heavy bodies of the
enemy were massing for a blow upon our front and where
he believed they would strike. This information, we were
told, he imparted to Hooker's chief of staff, and begged
permission to open at long range with his rifled guns, but
no attention was paid to him. I saw him up the tree and
heard some of his ejaculating, which indicated that he
was almost wild with apprehension of what was coming.
Once on coming down he remarked to General Hancock
that we would "catch h&mdash;l in less than an hour." The
latter seemed to be thoroughly alive to the situation and
exceedingly anxious, as were Couch and French, to do
something to prepare for what was coming, yet nothing
more was done until suddenly the firing, which had been
growing in volume and intensity and gradually drawing
nearer, developed in a storm of musketry of terrific fury
immediately in our right front, apparently not more than
three hundred yards away.</p>

<p>We could not see a thing. What there might be between
us and it, or whether it was the onslaught of the
enemy or the firing of our troops, we knew not. But we
had not long to wait. Soon stragglers, few in numbers,
began to appear, emerging from the woods into our clearing,
and then more of them, these running, and then
almost at once an avalanche of panic-stricken, flying men
without arms, without knapsacks, many bareheaded,
swearing, cursing, a wild, frenzied mob tearing to the
rear. Instantly they began to appear, General Couch,
commanding our corps, took in the situation and deployed
two divisions to catch and hold the fugitives.
Part of the Third Corps was also deployed on our left.
We were ordered to charge bayonets and permit no man
to pass through our ranks. We soon had a seething,
howling mob of Dutchmen twenty to thirty feet in depth
in front of our line, holding them back on the points of
our bayonets, and still they came. Every officer of our
division, with drawn sword and pistol, was required to
use all possible endeavor to hold them, and threatening to
shoot the first man who refused to stand as ordered. General
French and staff were galloping up and down our
division line assisting in this work.</p>

<p>In the mean time another line of battle was rapidly
thrown in between these fugitives and the woods to stay
the expected advance of the enemy. This was the famous
break of the Eleventh Corps, starting with Blenker's
division and finally extending through the whole corps,
some fifteen thousand men. It seemed as though the
whole army was being stampeded. We soon had a vast
throng of these fugitives dammed up in our front, a terrible
menace to the integrity of our own line as well as
of all in our rear. We were powerless to do anything
should the enemy break through, and were in great danger
of being ourselves swept away and disintegrated by this
frantic mob. All this time the air was filled with shrieking
shells from our own batteries as well as those of the
enemy, doing, however, little damage beyond adding to
the terror of the situation. The noise was deafening.
Pandemonium seemed to reign supreme in our front. Our
line, as well as that of the Third Corps on our left, was
holding firm as a rock. I noticed a general officer, I
thought it was General Sickles, was very conspicuous in
the vigor of his efforts to hold the line. A couple of fugitives
had broken through his line and were rapidly going
to the rear. I heard him order them to halt and turn
back. One of them turned and cast a look at him, but
paid no further attention to his order. He repeated the
order in stentorian tones, this time with his pistol levelled,
but it was not obeyed, and he fired, dropping the first man
dead in his tracks. He again ordered the other man to
halt, and it was sullenly obeyed. These men seemed to
be almost stupid, deaf to orders or entreaty in their frenzy.</p>

<p>An incident in our own front will illustrate. I noticed
some extra commotion near our colors and rushed to see
the cause. I found an officer with drawn sword threatening
to run the color-sergeant through if he was not
allowed to pass. He was a colonel and evidently a German.
My orders to him to desist were answered with a
curse, and I had to thrust my pistol into his face, with an
energetic threat to blow his head off if he made one more
move, before he seemed to come to his senses. I then
appealed to him to see what an example he as an officer
was setting, and demanded that he should get to work
and help to stem the flight of his men rather than assist
in their demoralization. To his credit be it said, he at
once regained his better self, and thenceforth did splendid
work up and down amongst these German fugitives, and
later on, when they were moved to the rear, he rendered
very material assistance. I did not learn who he was,
but he was a splendid-looking officer and spoke both English
and German fluently.</p>

<p>One may ask why those men should have lost their
heads so completely. To answer the question intelligently,
one needs to put oneself into their place. The
facts as we were told at the time were: That the
Eleventh Corps, which contained two divisions of German
troops, under Schurz and Blenker (I think Steinwehr
commanded the latter division in this action), was
posted on the right of Hooker's line in the woods, some
distance in front and to the right of the Chancellorsville
House. That at the time Stonewall Jackson made his
famous attack, above referred to, he caught one of those
divisions "napping"&mdash;off their guard. They had stacked
their guns and knapsacks, and were back some twenty
yards, making their evening coffee, when suddenly the
rebel skirmishers burst through the brush upon them,
followed immediately by the main line, and before they
realized it were between these troops and their guns.
Consternation reigned supreme in an instant and a
helter-skelter flight followed. Jackson followed up this
advantage with his usual impetuosity, and although the
other divisions of the Eleventh made an effort to hold
their ground, this big hole in the line was fatal to
them and all were quickly swept away. Of course,
the division and brigade commanders were responsible
for that unpardonable carelessness. No valid excuse can
be made for such criminal want of watchfulness, especially
for troops occupying a front line, and which had
heard, or should have heard, as we a half mile farther in
the rear had, all the premonitions of the coming storm.
But it was an incident showing the utter folly of the
attempt to maintain a line of battle in the midst of a
dense undergrowth, through which nothing could be seen.
It is exceedingly doubtful whether they could have held
their line against Jackson's onset under those conditions
had they been on the alert, for he would have been on
and over them almost before they could have seen him.
To resist such an onset needs time to deliver a steady
volley and then be ready with the bayonet.</p>

<p>It was towards six o'clock in the evening when this
flying mob struck our lines, and darkness had fallen
before we were rid of them and something like order had
been restored. In the mean time it certainly seemed as
if everything was going to pieces. I got a little idea of
what a panic-stricken army means. The fearful thing
about it was, we knew it was terribly contagious, and
that with all the uncertainties in that black wilderness
from which this mob came and the pandemonium in progress
all about us, it might seize our own troops and we be
swept away to certain destruction in spite of all our
efforts. It is said death rides on horseback with a fleeing
army. Nothing can be more horrible. Hence a panic
must be stopped, cost what it may. Night undoubtedly
came to our rescue with this one.</p>

<p>One of the most heroic deeds I saw done to help stem
the fleeing tide of men and restore courage was not the
work of a battery, nor a charge of cavalry, but the charge
of a band of music! The band of the Fourteenth Connecticut
went right out into that open space between our
new line and the rebels, with shot and shell crashing all
about them, and played "The Star-Spangled Banner,"
the "Red, White, and Blue," and "Yankee Doodle," and
repeated them for fully twenty minutes. They never
played better. Did that require nerve? It was undoubtedly
the first and only band concert ever given under
such conditions. Never was American grit more finely
illustrated. Its effect upon the men was magical. Imagine
the strains of our grand national hymn, "The Star-Spangled
Banner," suddenly bursting upon your ears out
of that horrible pandemonium of panic-born yells, mingled
with the roaring of musketry and the crashing of
artillery. To what may it be likened? The carol of birds
in the midst of the blackest thunder-storm? No simile
can be adequate. Its strains were clear and thrilling for
a moment, then smothered by that fearful din, an instant
later sounding bold and clear again, as if it would fearlessly
emphasize the refrain, "Our flag is still there."</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE&mdash;CONTINUED</p>


<p>R<span class="smcap">ecurring</span> again to the incident of the band playing
out there between the two hostile lines in the midst of that
panic of the Eleventh Corps, it was a remarkable circumstance
that none of them were killed. I think one or
two were slightly wounded by pieces of exploding shells,
and one or two of their instruments carried away scars
from that scene. The rebels did not follow up their advantage,
as we expected, probably owing to the effective
work of our batteries, otherwise they would all have been
either killed or captured. None of the enemy came into
our clearing that I saw. We must have corralled upward
of eight thousand of our demoralized men. Some had
their arms, most of them had none, which confirmed the
story of their surprise narrated in the last chapter. They
were marched to the rear under guard, and thus the
further spread of the panic was avoided.</p>

<p>It was now dark and the firing ceased, but only for a
few moments, for the two picket-lines were posted so
close together, neither knowing exactly where the other
was, that both were exceedingly nervous; and the slightest
movement, the stepping of a picket, the scurry of a
rabbit, would set the firing going again. First it would
be the firing of a single musket, then the quick rattle of
a half-dozen, then the whole line with the reserves, for all
were on the line together there; and then the batteries,
of which there were now at least a half-dozen massed
right around us, would open with terrific vigor, all firing
into the darkness, whence the enemy was supposed to be
coming. This continued at short intervals all night long.</p>

<p>After the mob of fugitives had been disposed of, our
division had formed in line of battle directly in front of
the Chancellorsville House, supporting the provisional
line which had been hurriedly thrown in to cover the
break of the Eleventh Corps, and we were "resting (?)
on our arms." At each of these alarms every man was
instantly on his feet, with guns at a "ready." General
French and staff were close to us, and General Couch
and his staff only a few feet away. All were exceedingly
nervous and keenly on the alert. It was a night of terrific
experience long to be remembered.</p>

<p>The nervous strain upon all was simply awful. We
knew that the Eleventh Corps had been stampeded by
the impetuous charge of Stonewall Jackson, and we felt
sure he would seek to reap the fruits of the break he had
made by an effort to pierce our centre, and this we would
have to meet and repel when it came. We did not then
know that in the general mix-up of that fateful afternoon
that able and intrepid leader had himself fallen and was
then dying. This fact, fortunate for us, undoubtedly
accounts for the failure of the expected onset to materialize.
We could probably have held him, for we had
two divisions of the Second Corps and part of the Third
Corps in double lines, all comparatively fresh, and before
midnight the First Corps was in position on our right.
But the slaughter would have been horrible.</p>

<p>After midnight these outbursts became less frequent,
and we officers lay down with the men and tried to sleep.
I do not think any of our general officers or their staffs
even sat down that whole night, so apprehensive were
they of the descent of the rebels upon our position. I
said in the last chapter that on Saturday morning some
beef cattle were slaughtered near our line for issue to
our division; that the work of distribution had not been
completed before the panic came, and then these carcasses
of beef were between ours and the rebel line on "debatable
ground." This was too much for some of our men, and
two or three crawled out to them during the night and
helped themselves to such cuts as they could make from
our side. One party next day told of being surprised by
hearing cutting on the other side of the beef, and found,
on investigating, that a "Johnny" was there, when the
following colloquy took place:</p>

<p>"Hello, Johnny, are ye there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Yank; too bad to let this 'fresh' spoil. I say,
Yank, lend me your knife, mine's a poor one. We 'uns
and you 'uns is all right here. Yank, I'll help you if
you'll help me, and we'll get all we want."</p>

<p>The knife was passed over, and these two foes helped
each other in that friendly darkness. How much actual
truth there was in this story I do not know, but I do
know that there was considerable fresh beef among the
men in the morning, and it was not at all unlikely that
the Johnnies also profited by the presence of that "fresh"
between the lines. Soldiers of either army would run
almost any risk to get a bit of fresh beef.</p>

<p>The next morning we were ordered to pile up our
knapsacks and make a breastwork of them for such protection
as they might afford, in anticipation of the still
expected attack. We managed to make a cup of coffee
and eat a hardtack without getting off our guard for an
instant, and about ten o'clock the First Brigade, now
Carroll's, and ours, consisting of two regiments only, the
First Delaware and ours, under command of our Colonel
Albright, were ordered forward into the woods to the
right of the Chancellorsville House. This was the opening
of the third day's battle. We moved forward in
excellent line until we struck the edge of the woods. The
moment the crackling of the brush under our feet apprised
the enemy of our advance we received a heavy volley,
which must have been very hurriedly delivered, for it
passed over our heads, not a man being hit, I think. The
morning was lowering and misty and the air very light,
so that the smoke made by the rebel volley, not more
than fifty yards away, hung like a chalk line and indicated
their exact position. The sudden retirement of our lieutenant-colonel
at this point placed the command of the
regiment on me, and I shouted to the men to aim below
that line of smoke and then gave the order, fire by battalion,
and we emptied our guns as one man, reloaded,
and receiving no reply to our volley, moved forward
through the thick brush and undergrowth. We soon
came upon the rebel line, and a dreadful sight it was.
The first officer I saw was a rebel captain, an Irishman.
He ejaculated, "We're all killed! We're all killed!" and
offered to surrender. The commanding officer must have
suffered the fate of his men. Most of them were either
killed or wounded. The hundred or so living promptly
threw down their arms, and Colonel Albright sent them
to the rear under guard. This Irish captain vouchsafed
the remark sotto voce that he was glad to be captured,
that he'd been trying to get out of the d&mdash;n Confederacy
for a year. Our battalion volley had exactly reached its
mark and had done fearful execution. There must have
been more than two hundred lying there either dead or
wounded, marking their line of battle. This was the
only instance in my war experience where we delivered
a volley as a battalion. The usual order of firing in line
of battle is by "file," each man firing as rapidly as he
can effectively, without regard to any other man. The
volley they had delivered at us was a battalion volley,
and it would have effectively disposed of our advance had
it been well delivered. Fortunately for us, it was not,
and their smoke-line gave us the opportunity to deliver
a very effective counter-stroke. It had to be quickly done,
we were so close together. There was no time to meditate.
It was us or them. Instantly I resolved to give
them all we could, aiming well under their line of smoke,
and take our chances with the bayonet if necessary. The
order was calmly given and the volley was coolly delivered.
I have never heard a better one. The value of
coolness in delivering and the effectiveness of such a
volley were clearly demonstrated in this instance.</p>

<p>We again moved forward, working our way through
the tangled undergrowth, and had gained probably five
or six hundred yards when we encountered another line,
and sharp firing began on both sides. We could see the
enemy dodging behind trees and stumps not more than
one hundred yards away. We also utilized the same
shelter, and therefore suffered comparatively little. Suddenly
I found bullets beginning to come from our left
and rear as well as from our front. Two of these bullets
had been aimed at me as I stood behind a small
tree on our line. The first knowledge I had of them was
from the splinters of bark in my face from the tree, first
one and then the other in quick succession as the bullets
struck, not more than three inches from my head. They
were fairly good shots. I was thankful they were no
better. But now I had to move a couple of companies to
the left to meet this flank attack. It did not prove a
serious matter, and the enemy was quickly driven back.
The same thing was tried shortly after on our right flank,
and was again disposed of the same way. They were
probably groups of sharpshooters hunting for our officers.
One of them, I happened to know, never went back, for I
saw one of our sergeants kill him. I was at that moment
standing by him, when he clapped his hand to his ear
and exclaimed, "That was a 'hot one,'" as a bullet just
ticked it. "There is the devil who did it. See him
behind that bush?" and with that he aimed and fired.
The fellow rolled over dead.</p>

<p>We soon had the better of this fighting and our opponents
withdrew. We seemed now to be isolated. We
must have been nearly a half mile from where we entered
the woods. We could not see nor hear of any troops on
our immediate right or left. Colonel Albright came back
to consult as to what was best to be done now. The brush
and undergrowth were exceedingly dense. What there
might be on our right or left we could not know without
sending skirmishers out. The colonel said his orders
were to advance and engage the enemy. No orders had
come to him since our advance commenced, two hours
and more before. We had met and beaten two lines of
the enemy. Should we continue the advance or retire
and get further orders? My advice was to retire; that
with our small force, not more than five hundred men,
isolated in that dense wood, we were liable to be gobbled
up. The colonel agreed with this view and ordered the
line faced about and marched to the rear. I mention this
consultation over the situation because here we were,
two young men, who knew almost nothing about military
matters beyond obeying orders, suddenly called upon
to exercise judgment in a critical situation. Bravery suggested
push ahead and fight. To retire savored of over-prudence.
Nevertheless, it seemed to us we had no business
remaining out there without connection with other
troops on either right or left, and this decided the colonel
to order the retreat.</p>

<p>We moved back in line of battle in excellent order and
quite leisurely, having no opposition and, so far as we
knew, no troops following us. We came out into the
clearing just where we had entered the woods two hours
before. But here we met a scene that almost froze our
blood. During our absence some half-dozen batteries,
forty or more guns, had been massed here. Hurried
earthworks had been thrown up, covering the knapsacks
our brigade had left there when we advanced. These
guns were not forty yards away and were just waiting
the order to open on those woods right where we were.
As we emerged from the brush, our colors, fortunately,
were a little in advance, and showed through before the
line appeared. Their timely appearance, we were told,
saved us from being literally blown to pieces by those
batteries. A second later the fatal order would have been
given and our brigade would have been wiped out of
existence by our own guns!</p>

<p>As we came out of the woods an aide galloped down
to us, his face perfectly livid, and in a voice portraying
the greatest excitement shouted to Colonel Albright:
"What in h&mdash;l and d-mnation are you doing here? Get
out of here! Those woods are full of rebel troops, and
we are just waiting to open on them." Albright replied
very coolly, "Save your ammunition. There is not a
rebel within a half mile, for we have just marched back
that distance absolutely unmolested. Why haven't you
sent us orders? We went in here two hours ago, and
not an order have we received since." He replied, "We
have sent a dozen officers in to you with orders, and they
all reported that you had been captured." Albright answered,
"They were a lot of cowards, for there hasn't
been a minute since we advanced that an officer could not
have come directly to us. There is something wrong
about this. I will go and see General Hooker." And
directing me to move the troops away from the front of
those guns, he started for General Hooker's head-quarters,
only a short distance away. As I was passing the
right of that line of batteries a voice hailed me, and I
turned, and there stood one of my old Scranton friends,
Captain Frank P. Amsden, in command of his battery.
Said he, as he gripped my hand, "Boy, you got out of
those woods just in time. Our guns are double-shotted
with grape and canister; the word 'fire' was just on my
lips when your colors appeared." I saw his gunners
standing with their hands on the lanyards. After forty
years my blood almost creeps as I recall that narrow
escape.</p>

<p>We now moved to the rear across the plank-road from
the Chancellorsville House in the woods, where we supported
Hancock's line. Colonel Albright soon returned
from his visit to Hooker's head-quarters. His account
of that visit was most remarkable, and was substantially
as follows: "I scratched on the flap of the Hooker head-quarters'
tent and instantly an officer appeared and asked
what was wanted. I said I must see General Hooker,
that I had important information for him. He said,
'You cannot see General Hooker; I am chief of staff;
any information you have for the commanding general
should be given to me.' I said, 'I must see General
Hooker,' and with that pushed myself by him into the
tent, and there lay General Hooker, apparently dead
drunk. His face and position gave every indication of
that condition, and I turned away sick and disgusted."
It was subsequently stated that General Hooker was unconscious
at that time from the concussion of a shell.
That he was standing on the porch of the Chancellorsville
House, leaning against one of its supports, when a
shell struck it, rendering him unconscious. The incident
narrated above occurred about one <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on Sunday,
May 3. The army was practically without a commander
from this time until after sundown of that day, when
General Hooker reappeared and in a most conspicuous
manner rode around between the lines of the two armies.
If he was physically disabled, why was not the fact made
known at once to the next officer in rank, whose duty it
would have been to have assumed command of the army,
and if possible stem the tide of defeat now rapidly overwhelming
us? A half-day of most precious time would
have been saved. That this was not done I happen to
know from the following circumstances.</p>

<p>In our new position we were only about fifty yards
behind General Hancock's line. The head-quarters at
this time of General Couch, commanding our corps; of
General French, commanding our division, and of General
Hancock were all at the right of our regiment, behind
our line. These generals and their staffs were resting,
as were our troops, and they were sitting about, only a
few feet away from us. We therefore heard much of
their conversation. Directly General Howard joined
them. I well remember his remarks concerning the behavior
of his corps on the previous afternoon. His chagrin
was punctured with the advice of old French to
shoot a few dozen of them for example's sake. Naturally,
the chief subject of their conversation related to the
present situation. It was perfectly clear they regarded
it as very critical. We could hear heavy cannonading in
the distance towards Fredericksburg. Several times
Hancock broke out with a savage oath as he impatiently
paced up and down, swinging his sword. "They are
knocking Sedgwick to pieces. Why don't we go forward?"
or a similar ejaculation, and then, "General
Couch, why do you not assume command and order us
forward? It is your duty." (The latter was next in
rank to Hooker.)</p>

<p>To which General Couch replied, "I cannot assume
command." French and Howard agreed with Hancock,
but Couch remained imperturbable, saying, "When I am
properly informed that General Hooker is disabled and
not in command, I shall assume the duty which will devolve
upon me." And so hour after hour passed of
inactivity at this most critical juncture. They said it
was plain Lee was making simply a show of force in our
front whilst he had detached a large part of his army and
was driving Sedgwick before him down at Fredericksburg.
Now, why this period of inactivity whilst Sedgwick
was being punished? Why this interregnum in the
command? When Colonel Albright returned from his
call at Hooker's tent, narrated above, he freely expressed
his opinion that Hooker's condition was as stated above.
His views were then generally believed by those about
head-quarters, and this was understood as the reason why
the next officer in rank was not officially notified of his
chief's disability and the responsibility of the command
placed upon him. Nothing was then said about the concussion
of a shell. It is profoundly to be hoped that
Colonel Albright's impression was wrong, and that the
disability was produced, as alleged, by concussion of a
shell. If so, there was a very grave dereliction of duty
on the part of his chief of staff in not imparting the fact
immediately to General Couch, the officer next in rank,
and devolving the command upon him.</p>

<p>In our new position on the afternoon of Sunday, the
third day's battle, we were subjected to a continuous fire
of skirmishers and sharpshooters, without the ability of
replying. We laid up logs for a barricade and protected
ourselves as well as we could. Several were wounded
during the afternoon, among them Captain Hall, of Company
I. His was a most singular wound. We were all
lying prone upon the ground, when suddenly he spoke
rather sharply and said he had got a clip on his knee.
He said it was an insignificant flesh wound, but his leg
was benumbed. He tried to step on it, but could not
bear his weight on it, and very soon it became exceedingly
painful, and his ankle swelled to double its natural size.
He was taken back to one of the hospitals, where it was
found a minie-ball had entered his leg above the knee and
passed down between the bones to the ankle, where it
was removed. This practically ended the service of one
of the youngest of our captains, a brave and brilliant
young officer.</p>

<p>Towards night a cold, drizzling rain set in, which
chilled us to our bones. We could not have any fires, not
even to make our coffee, for fear of disclosing our position
to the enemy. For four days now we had been continuously
under the terrible nervous strain incident to a
battle and practically without any rest or sleep. During
this time we had no cooked food, nothing but hardtack
and raw pork and coffee but once. This condition began
to tell upon us all. I had been under the weather when
the movement began, and was ordered by our surgeon to
remain behind, but I said no, not as long as I could get
around. Now I found my strength had reached its limit,
and I took that officer's advice, with the colonel's orders,
and went back to the division field hospital to get under
cover from the rain and get a night's sleep if possible.</p>

<p>I found a half-dozen hospital tents standing together
as one hospital, and all full to overflowing with sick and
wounded men. Our brigade surgeon, a personal friend,
was in charge. He finally found a place for me just
under the edge of one of the tents, where I could keep
part of the rain off. He brought me a stiff dose of
whiskey and quinine, the universal war remedy, and I
drank it and lay down, and was asleep in less time than it
takes me to write it.</p>

<p>About midnight the surgeon came and aroused me with
the information that the army was moving back across
the river, and that all in the hospital who could march
were ordered to make their way back as best they could;
that of the others the ambulances would carry all they
could and the others would be left. This was astounding
information. My first impulse was, of course, to return
to my regiment, but the doctor negatived that emphatically
by saying, "You are under my orders here, and
my instructions are to send you all directly back to the
ford and across the river; and then the army is already
on the march, and you might as well attempt to find a
needle in a haystack as undertake to find your regiment
in these woods in this darkness." If his first reason had
not been sufficient, the latter one was quite convincing.
I realized at once the utter madness of any attempt to
reach the regiment, at the same time that in this night
tramp back over the river, some eight miles, I had a job
that would tax my strength to the utmost. The doctor
had found one of the men of our regiment who was sick,
and bidding us help each other started us back over the
old plank-road.</p>

<p>How shall I describe the experiences of that night's
tramp? The night was intensely dark and it was raining
hard. The plank-road was such only in name. What
few remnants remained of the old planks were rotten and
were a constant menace to our footing. I must have
had more than a dozen falls during that march from
those broken planks, until face, arms, and legs were a
mass of bruises. We were told to push forward as rapidly
as we could to keep ahead of the great rabble of sick
and wounded which was to follow immediately. This
we tried to do, though the road was now crowded with
the occupants of the other hospitals already on their way.
These men were all either sick or wounded, and were
making their way with the greatest difficulty, most of
them in silence, but there was an occasional one whose
tongue gave expression to every possible mishap in outbursts
of the most shocking profanity. There were
enough of these to make the night hideous.</p>

<p>Our road was a track just wide enough to admit a
single wagon through the densest jungle of timber and
undergrowth I ever saw. I cannot imagine the famed
jungles of Africa more dense or impenetrable, and it
seemed to be without end as we wearily plodded on hour
after hour, now stepping into a hole and sprawling in
the mud, again stumbling against a stolid neighbor and
being in turn jostled by him, with an oath for being in
his way. Many a poor fellow fell, too exhausted to rise,
and we were too nearly dead to do more than mechanically
note the fact.</p>

<p>Towards morning a quartette of men overtook us
carrying a man on their shoulders. As they drew near us
one of the forward pair stumbled and fell, and down
came the body into the mud with a swash. If the body
was not dead, the fall killed it, for it neither moved nor
uttered a sound. With a fearful objurgation they went
on and left it, and we did not have life enough left in us
to make any investigation. It was like the case of a
man on the verge of drowning seeing others perishing
without the ability to help. It was a serious question
whether we could pull ourselves through or should be
obliged to drop in our tracks, to be run over and crushed
or trampled to death, as many a poor fellow was that
night. We had not an ounce of strength, nor had any of
the hundreds of others in our condition, to bestow on
those who could not longer care for themselves. Here it
was every man for himself. This night's experience was
a horrible nightmare.</p>

<p>It was long after daylight when we crawled out of
those woods and reached United States ford. Here a
pontoon bridge had been thrown over, and a double column
of troops and a battery of artillery were crossing
at the same time. We pushed ourselves into the throng,
as to which there was no semblance of order, and were
soon on the other side. On the top of the bluff, some
one hundred feet above the river, on our side, we noticed
a hospital tent, and we thought if we could reach that we
might find shelter and rest, for it was still raining and
we were drenched to the skin, and so cold that our faces
were blue and our teeth chattered. A last effort landed
us at this hospital. Alas for our hopes! it was crowded
like sardines in a box with others who in like condition
had reached it before us. I stuck my head in the tent.
One glance was enough. The surgeon in charge, in answer
to our mute appeal, said, "God help you, boys; I
cannot. But here is a bottle of whiskey, take a good
drink; it will do you good." We took a corking dose,
nearly half the bottle, and lay down, spoon fashion, my
comrade and I, by the side of that tent in the rain and
slept for about an hour, until the stimulus of the liquor
passed off and the cold began again to assert itself, when
we had to start on again. I have never had any use for
liquors in my life, and the use of them in any form as a
beverage I consider as nothing else than harmful in the
highest degree, yet I have always felt that this big dose
of whiskey saved my life. Could we have had a good
cup of hot coffee at that time it would possibly have been
better, but we might as well have looked for lodgings in
the Waldorf-Astoria as for coffee at that time and place.
Imagine my feelings during all this night as I reflected
that I had a good horse, overcoat, and gum blanket somewhere,&mdash;yes,
somewhere, back, or wherever my regiment
might be,&mdash;and here I was soaking wet, chilled to the
bones and almost dead from tramping.</p>

<p>We got word at the Ford that the troops were to go
back to their old camps, and there was nothing for us to
do but to make our way back there as best we might.
Soon after we started Colonel (afterwards Judge Dana,
of Wilkes-Barre) Dana's regiment passed. The colonel
hailed me and kindly inquired why I happened to be there
by myself on foot, said I looked most wretched, and insisted
on my taking another bracer from a little emergency
stock he had preserved. I had been but a few months
out of his law office, from which I had been admitted to
the bar. His kindly attentions under these limited circumstances
were very cheering and helpful. We were
all day covering the eight or more miles back to camp.
But early in the day the rain ceased, the sun came out,
we got warmed up marching, and after some hours our
clothes became sufficiently dry to be more comfortable,
so that when we reached camp in the evening our condition
was much improved. This was due in part probably
as much to the relief from the awful nervous strain of the
battle and the conditions through which we had passed
in that wilderness as to rest and the changed weather.
When we reached this side of the river that nervous strain
ceased. We were sure that fighting was over, at least for
the present. We found the regiment had been in camp
some hours ahead of us. Our corps was probably on the
march when we left the hospital, and had preceded us all
the way back. I found my horse had brought back one
of our wounded men, and this was some compensation
for my own loss.</p>

<p>We had been gone on this campaign from the 29th of
April until the 5th of May, and such a week! How much
that was horrible had been crowded into it. For variety
of experiences of the many dreadful sides of war, that
week far exceeded any other like period of our service.
The fighting was boy's play compared with either Antietam
or Fredericksburg, yet for ninety-six hours continuously
we were under the terrible nervous strain of battle.
Our losses in this action were comparatively light, 2 men
killed, 2 officers wounded (one of whom died a few days
later), and 39 men wounded, and one man missing; total
loss, 44, or about fifteen per cent. of the number we took
into action. This missing man I met at the recent reunion
of our regiment. He was picked up from our skirmish
line by that flanking party of rebels on the third day's
fight described in my last. The circumstance will show
how close the rebels were upon us before we discovered
them. Our skirmishers could not have been more than
a dozen yards in advance of our main line, yet the thicket
was so dense that the enemy was on him before he fairly
realized it. He said he was placed with a lot of other
prisoners and marched to the rear some distance, under
guard, when a fine-looking Confederate officer rode up
to them. He was told it was General Lee. He said he
wore long, bushy whiskers and addressed them with a
cheery,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-morning, boys. What did you come down
here for? a picnic? You didn't think you could whip us
men of the South, did you?"</p>

<p>One of the prisoners spoke up in reply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, d&mdash;n you, we did, and we will. You haven't
won this fight yet, and Joe Hooker will lick h&mdash;l out of
you and recapture us before you get us out of these
woods."</p>

<p>The general laughed good-naturedly at the banter his
questions had elicited, and solemnly assured them that
there were not men enough in the whole North to take
Richmond. Our man was probably misinformed as to
who their interlocutor was. General Lee did not wear
long, bushy whiskers, and was at that time probably down
directing operations against Fredericksburg. This was
probably Jeb Stuart, who had succeeded Jackson in command
of that wing of the rebel army.</p>

<p>Our prisoner fared much better than most prisoners,
for it was his good fortune to be exchanged after twenty-three
days' durance, probably owing to the expiration of
his term of service. Although the actual dates of enlistment
of our men were all in July and their terms therefore
expired, the government insisted upon holding us for
the full period of nine months from the date of actual
muster into the United States service, which would not
be completed until the 14th of May. We had, therefore,
eight days' service remaining after our return from the
battle of Chancellorsville, and we were continued in all
duties just as though we had months yet to serve. Our
principal work was the old routine of picket duty again.
Our friends, the enemy, were now quick to tantalize our
pickets with the defeat at Chancellorsville. Such remarks
as these were volleyed at us:</p>

<p>"We 'uns give you 'uns a right smart lickin' up in
them woods."</p>

<p>"How d'ye like Virginny woods, Yank?"</p>

<p>And then they sang to us:</p>

<p class="poem">"Ain't ye mighty glad to get out the wilderness?"</p>

<p>A song just then much in vogue. Another volunteered
the remark, as if to equalize the honors in some measure,
"If we did wallop you 'uns, you 'uns killed our best
general." "We feel mighty bad about Stonewall's
death," and so their tongues would run on, whether our
men replied or not.</p>

<p class="c smcap">THE MUSTER OUT AND HOME AGAIN</p>


<p>O<span class="smcap">n</span> the 14th of May we received orders to proceed to
Harrisburg for muster out. There was, of course, great
rejoicing at the early prospect of home scenes once more.
We walked on air, and lived for the next few days in
fond anticipation. We were the recipients of any amount
of attention from our multitude of friends in the division.
Many were the forms of leave-taking that took place. It
was a great satisfaction to realize that in our comparatively
brief period of service we had succeeded in winning
our way so thoroughly into the big hearts of those veterans.
The night before our departure was one of the
gladdest and saddest of all our experience. The Fourteenth
Connecticut band, that same band which had so
heroically played out between the lines when the Eleventh
Corps broke on that fateful Saturday night at Chancellorsville,
came over and gave us a farewell serenade.
They played most of the patriotic airs, with "Home,
Sweet Home," which I think never sounded quite so
sadly sweet, and suggestively wound up with "When
Johnny Comes Marching Home." Most of the officers
and men of the brigade were there to give us a soldier's
good-by, and Major-General Couch, commanding our
corps (the Second), also paid us the compliment of a
visit and made a pleasant little speech to the men who
were informally grouped around head-quarters, commending
our behavior in three of the greatest battles of
the war.</p>

<p>It had been our high honor, he said, to have had a part
in those great battles, and though new and untried we
had acquitted ourselves with great credit and had held
our ground like veterans. He expressed the fervent hope
that our patriotism would still further respond to the
country's needs, and that we would all soon again be in
the field. Our honors were not yet complete. General
French, commanding our division, issued a farewell order,
a copy of which I would have been glad to publish, but
I have not been able to get it. It was, however, gratifying
in the extreme. He recounted our bravery under his
eye in those battles and our efficient service on all duty,
and wound up by saying he felt sure that men with such
a record could not long remain at home, but would soon
again rally around their country's flag. Of General
Couch, our corps commander, we had seen but little, and
were therefore very pleasantly surprised at his visit. Of
General French, bronzed and grizzly bearded, we had
seen much; all our work had been under his immediate
supervision. He was a typical old regular, and many
were the cuffs and knocks we received for our inexperience
and shortcomings, all, however, along the lines of
discipline and for our good, and which had really helped
to make soldiers of us. These incidents showed that
each commanding general keeps a keen eye on all his
regiments, and no one is quicker to detect and appreciate
good behavior than they. We felt especially pleased with
the praises of General French, because it revealed the
other side of this old hero's character. Rough in exterior
and manner of speech, he was a strong character and a
true hero.</p>

<p>His position at the breaking out of the war will illustrate
this. He was a Southerner of the type of Anderson
and Farragut. When so many of his fellows of the
regular army, under pretext of following their States,
went over into rebellion and treason, he stood firm and
under circumstances which reflect great credit upon him.
He had been in Mexico and had spent a life on the
frontier, and had grown old and gray in the service, reaching
only the rank of captain. When the war finally came
he was in command of a battery of artillery stationed
some three hundred and fifty miles up the Rio Grande,
on the border of Mexico. He was cut off from all communication
with Washington, and the commander of his
department, the notorious General David E. Twiggs, had
gone over to the Confederacy. He was, therefore, thoroughly
isolated. Twiggs sent him a written order to
surrender his battery to the rebel commander of that
district. His characteristic reply was, that he would "see
him and the Confederacy in hell first;" that he was going
to march his battery into God's country, and if anybody
interfered with his progress they might expect a dose of
shot and shell they would long remember. None of them
felt disposed to test his threat, and so he marched his
battery alone down through that rebel country those three
hundred and fifty miles and more into our lines at the
mouth of the Rio Grande, bringing off every gun and
every dollar's worth of government property that he could
carry, and what he could not carry he destroyed. He was
immediately ordered north with his battery and justly
rewarded with a brigadier-general's commission.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 15th we broke camp and
bade farewell to that first of the world's great armies, the
grand old Army of the Potomac. Need I say that, joyous
as was our home-going, there was more than a pang at
the bottom of our hearts as we severed those heroic associations?
A last look at the old familiar camp, a wave of
the hand to the friendly adieus of our comrades, whose
good-by glances indicated that they would gladly have
exchanged places with us; that if our hearts were wrung
at going, theirs were, too, at remaining; a last march
down those Falmouth hills, another and last glance at
those terrible works behind Fredericksburg, and we
passed out of the army and out of the soldier into the
citizen, for our work was now done and we were soldiers
only in name.</p>

<p>As our train reached Belle-plain, where we were to
take boat for Washington, we noticed a long train of
ambulances moving down towards the landing, and were
told they were filled with wounded men, just now brought
off the field at Chancellorsville. There were upward of
a thousand of them. It seems incredible that the wounded
should have been left in those woods during these ten to
twelve days since the battle. How many hundreds perished
during that time for want of care nobody knows,
and, more horrible still, nobody knows how many poor
fellows were burned up in the portions of those woods
that caught fire from the artillery. But such is war.
Dare any one doubt the correctness of Uncle Billy Sherman's
statement that "War is hell!"</p>

<p>Reaching Washington, the regiment bivouacked a single
night, awaiting transportation to Harrisburg. During
this time discipline was relaxed and the men were permitted
to see the capital city. The lieutenant-colonel and
I enjoyed the extraordinary luxury of a good bath, a
square meal, and a civilized bed at the Metropolitan
Hotel, the first in five long months. Singular as it may
seem, I caught a terrific cold as the price I paid for it.
The next day we were again back in Camp Curtin, at
Harrisburg, with nothing to do but to make out the necessary
muster rolls, turn in our government property,&mdash;guns,
accoutrements, blankets, etc., and receive our discharges.
This took over a week, so that it was the 24th
of May before we were finally discharged and paid off.
Then the several companies finally separated.</p>

<p>If it had been hard to leave our comrades of the Army
of the Potomac, it was harder to sever the close comradeship
of our own regiment, a relationship formed and
cemented amidst the scenes that try men's souls, a comradeship
born of fellowship in privation, danger, and
suffering. I could hardly restrain my tears as we finally
parted with our torn and tattered colors, the staff of one
of which had been shot away in my hands. We had
fought under their silken folds on three battle-fields, upon
which we had left one-third of our number killed and
wounded, including a colonel and three line officers and
upward of seventy-five men killed and two hundred and
fifteen wounded. Out of our regiment of one thousand
and twenty-four men mustered into the service August
14, 1862, we had present at our muster out six hundred
and eighteen. We had lost in battle two hundred and
ninety-five in killed and wounded and one hundred and
eleven from physical disability, sickness, etc., and all in
the short space of nine months. Of the sixteen nine-months
regiments formed in August, 1862, the One Hundred
and Thirtieth and ours were the only regiments to
actively participate in the three great battles of Antietam,
Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, and we lost more
men than either of the others.</p>

<p>I should mention a minor incident that occurred during
our stay in Harrisburg preparing for muster out. A
large number of our men had asked me to see if I could
not get authority to re-enlist a battalion from the regiment.
I was assured that three-fourths of the men would
go back with me, provided they could have a two weeks'
furlough. I laid the matter before Governor Curtin. He
said the government should take them by all means; that
here was a splendid body of seasoned men that would be
worth more than double their number of new recruits;
but he was without authority to take them, and suggested
that I go over to Washington and lay the matter before
the Secretary of War. He gave me a letter to the latter
and I hurried off. I had no doubt of my ability to raise
an entire regiment from the great number of nine-months
men now being discharged. I repaired to the War Department,
and here my troubles began. Had the lines of
sentries that guarded the approach to the armies in the
field been half as efficient as the cordon of flunkies that
barred the way to the War Office, the former would have
been beyond the reach of any enemy. At the entrance
my pedigree was taken, with my credentials and a statement
of my business. I was finally permitted to sit down
in a waiting-room with a waiting crowd. Occasionally
a senator or a congressman would break the monotony
by pushing himself in whilst we cultivated our patience
by waiting. Lunch time came and went. I waited. Several
times I ventured some remarks to the attendant as
to when I might expect my turn to come, but he looked
at me with a sort of far-off look, as though I could not
have realized to whom I was speaking. Finally, driven
to desperation, after waiting more than four hours, I
tried a little bluster and insisted that I would go in and
see somebody. Then I was assured that the only official
about the office was a Colonel&mdash;&mdash;, acting assistant
adjutant-general. I might see him.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "let me see him, anybody!"</p>

<p>I was ushered into the great official's presence. He
was a lieutenant-colonel, just one step above my own
rank. He was dressed in a faultless new uniform. His
hair was almost as red as a fresh red rose and parted in
the middle, and his pose and dignity were quite worthy
of the national snob hatchery at West Point, of which he
was a recent product.</p>

<p>"Young man," said he, with a supercilious air, "what
might your business be?"</p>

<p>I stated that I had brought a letter from His Excellency,
Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, to the Secretary
of War, whom I desired to see on important business.</p>

<p>"Where is your letter, sir?"</p>

<p>"I gave it up to the attendant four hours ago, who, I
supposed, took it to the Secretary."</p>

<p>"There is no letter here, sir! What is your business?
You cannot see the Secretary of War."</p>

<p>I then briefly stated my errand. His reply was,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young man, if you really desire to serve your country,
go home and enlist."</p>

<p>Thoroughly disgusted, I retired, and so ended what
might have saved to the service one of the best bodies of
men that ever wore a government uniform, and at a time
when the country was sorely in need of them.</p>

<p>A word now of the personnel of the One Hundred and
Thirty-second Regiment and I am done. Dr. Bates, in
his history of the Pennsylvania troops, remarks that this
regiment was composed of a remarkable body of men.
This judgment must have been based upon his knowledge
of their work. Every known trade was represented in
its ranks. Danville gave us a company of iron workers
and merchants, Catawissa and Bloomsburg, mechanics,
tradesmen, and farmers. From Mauch Chunk we had
two companies, which included many miners. From
Wyoming and Bradford we had three companies of
sturdy, intelligent young farmers intermingled with some
mechanics and tradesmen. Scranton, small as she was
then, gave us two companies, which was scarcely a moiety
of the number she sent into the service. I well remember
how our flourishing Young Men's Christian Association
was practically suspended because its members had gone
to the war, and old Nay Aug Hose Company, the pride
of the town, in which many of us had learned the little
we knew of drill, was practically defunct for want of a
membership which had "gone to the war." Of these two
Scranton companies, Company K had as its basis the old
Scranton City Guard, a militia organization which, if not
large, was thoroughly well drilled and made up of most
excellent material. Captain Richard Stillwell, who commanded
this company, had organized the City Guard and
been its captain from the beginning. The other Scranton
company was perhaps more distinctively peculiar in its
personnel than either of the other companies. It was
composed almost exclusively of Delaware, Lackawanna
&amp; Western Railroad shop and coal men, and was known
as the Railroad Guards. In its ranks were locomotive
engineers, firemen, brakemen, trainmen, machinists, telegraph
operators, despatchers, railroad-shop men, a few
miners, foremen, coal-breaker men, etc. Their captain,
James Archbald, Jr., was assistant to his father as chief
engineer of the road, and he used to say that with his
company he could survey, lay out, build and operate a
railroad. The first sergeant of that company, George
Conklin, brother of D. H. Conklin, chief despatcher of
the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western, and his assistant,
had been one of the first to learn the art of reading telegraph
messages by ear, an accomplishment then quite
uncommon. His memory had therefore been so developed
that after a few times calling his company roll he
dispensed with the book and called it alphabetically from
memory. Keeping a hundred names in his mind in proper
order we thought quite a feat. Forty years later, at one
of our reunions, Mr. Conklin, now superintendent of a
railroad, was present. I asked him if he remembered
calling his company roll from memory.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "and I can do it now, and recall every
face and voice," and he began and rattled off the names
of his roll. He said sometimes in the old days the boys
would try to fool him by getting a comrade to answer
for them, but they could never do it, he would detect the
different voice instantly.</p>

<p>Now, as I close this narrative, shall I speak of the gala
day of our home-coming? I can, of course, only speak
of the one I participated in, the coming home to Scranton
of Companies I and K and the members of the field and
staff who lived here. This, however, will be a fair description
of the reception each of the other companies
received at their respective homes. Home-coming from
the war! Can we who know of it only as we read appreciate
such a home-coming? That was forty-one years
ago the 25th of last May. Union Hall, on Lackawanna
Avenue, midway between Wyoming and Penn, had been
festooned with flags, and in it a sumptuous dinner awaited
us. A committee of prominent citizens, our old friends,
not one of whom is now living, met us some distance
down the road. A large delegation of Scranton's ladies
were at the hall to welcome and serve us, and of these,
the last one, one of the mothers and matrons, has just
passed into the great beyond. Many of those of our own
age, the special attraction of the returning "boys," have
also gone, but a goodly number still remain. They will
recall this picture with not a little interest, I am sure.
If perchance cheeks should be wet and spectacles moistened
as they read, it will be but a reproduction of the
emotions of that beautiful day more than forty years ago.
No soldier boys ever received a more joyous or hearty
welcome. The bountiful repast was hurriedly eaten, for
anxious mothers, wives, sisters, and sweethearts were
there, whose claim upon their returning "boy in blue" for
holier and tenderer relationship was paramount.</p>

<p>Amidst all these joyous reunions, were there no
shadows? Ah, yes. In the brief period of nine months
our regiment had lost forty per cent. of its membership.
Company I had gone to the front with one hundred and
one stalwart officers and men, and but sixty-eight came
back with the company. Of the missing names, Daniel
S. Gardner, Moses H. Ames, George H. Cator, Daniel
Reed, Richard A. Smith, and John B. West were killed
in battle or died of wounds soon after; Orville Sharp had
died in the service. The others had succumbed to the
hardships of the service and been discharged. Of the
same number Company K took into the service, sixty-six
came home with the company. Sergeant Martin L.
Hower, Richard Davis, Jacob Eschenbach, Jephtha Milligan,
Allen Sparks, Obadiah Sherwood, and David C.
Young had been killed in battle or died of wounds;
Thomas D. Davis, Jesse P. Kortz, Samuel Snyder, James
Scull, Solon Searles, and John W. Wright had died in
the service. The most conspicuous figure in the regiment,
our colonel, Richard A. Oakford, had been the first to
fall. So that amidst our rejoicings there were a multitude
of hearts unutterably sad. Will the time ever come
when "the bitter shall not be mingled with the sweet"
and tears of sorrow shall not drown the cup of gladness?
Let us hope and pray that it may; and now, as Father
Time tenderly turns down the heroic leaf of the One
Hundred and Thirty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers, let
us find comfort in the truth,</p>

<h3><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h3>
<hr class="single" />


<p class="sml1">The following are copies of the muster-out rolls of the Field and
Staff and the several companies of the One Hundred and Thirty-second
Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, taken originally from
Bates's History, and compared and corrected from the original rolls
in the Adjutant-General's office, at Harrisburg, Pa. Several corrections
have been made from the personal recollections of officers and
men whom I have been able to consult. There are doubtless errors in
the original rolls, owing to the paucity of records in the hands of
those whose duty it was to make them at the time of muster-out,
owing to resignations and other casualties. Some of these officers
were new in the command, and complete records were not in their
hands. It will be remembered that the whole period of service of
the One Hundred and Thirty-second was occupied in the three
strenuous campaigns of Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville,
during which regimental and company baggage, which included
official records, were seldom seen, and in many cases were
entirely lost. For example, at the battle of Chancellorsville on the
fateful 3d of May, we had lain in line of battle behind our knapsacks
piled up in twos, as a little protection from bullets. When we were
ordered forward, so quick was the movement, that these knapsacks,
and officers' luggage as well, were ordered to be left. When, two
hours later, on our return we reached this ground, we found our
knapsacks were at the bottom of an earth-work which had been
hurriedly thrown up during our absence, over which a line of
batteries thrust the frowning muzzles of their guns. With one or
two exceptions (where the officer commanding the company happened
to have it in his pocket), the company rolls were lost in
the knapsacks of the first sergeant, whose duty it was to carry it.
Thereupon new rolls had to be made up, and of course mostly from
memory. Under all these circumstances, the wonder is that there
are not more errors in them. Almost at the last moment did I
learn that I could include these rolls in my book, without exceeding
its limits under the contract price. During this time I have endeavored
at considerable expense and labor to get them correct,
but even so, I cannot hope that they are more than approximately
complete. Nothing can be more sacred or valuable to the veteran
and his descendants than his war record. The difficulty with these
rolls will be found I fear not so much in what is so briefly stated,
but in what has been inadvertently omitted, and which was necessary
to a complete record. There are a number of desertions. I
have given them as they are on the rolls. It is possible that some
of these men may have dropped out of the column from exhaustion
on the march, fallen sick and had been taken to some hospital
and died without identification. Failing to report at roll-call and
being unaccounted for, they would be carried on the company rolls
as "absent without leave," until prolonged absence without information
would compel the adding of the fearful word "deserted."
There were instances where men taken sick made their way home
without leave and were marked deserters. After recovering from
a severe case of "army fever" they returned again to duty. This
was in violation of discipline, and under the strict letter of the
law they were deserters, but they saved the government the cost
of their nursing, and, what is more, probably saved their lives and
subsequent service by their going. I mention these things so that
where the record appears harsh, the reader may know that possibly,
if all the facts had been known, it might have been far different.</p>

J. M. Newton of that regiment.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-E" id="Footnote-E"></a> This eye-witness was Captain Haviland, Company G, One Hundred
and Forty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment
was attached to the Pennsylvania Reserves, and which lost in that
charge two hundred and forty-three men killed and wounded. Captain
Haviland had been wounded, and was making his way with
Major John Bradley, also wounded, to the hospital. They happened
to be passing Birney's head-quarters when Meade rode up,
and heard the whole interview.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-F" id="Footnote-F"></a> This order was dated January 23, 1863, and can be found
in the Annual American Cyclopædia, 1863, page 79, with a copious
extract from the report of the Committee of Congress on the Conduct
of the War. It is there stated that this order was issued subject
to the President's approval, and was sent to Washington for
that purpose, General Burnside soon following and interviewing the
President. It is also stated that it was not approved and was not
published. How, then, did I come in possession of its main features,
so as to note them in my diary at the time? And how should my
recollection of them be so clear, as they certainly are, unless it had
been made public. Possibly the press may have published it. It
was certainly published in some form.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-G" id="Footnote-G"></a> Bates's History, Pennsylvania Volunteers, places here the name
of "Charles A. Meylert, second lieutenant, promoted from private,
Co. K, Feb. 23, 1863, missing since that date." Co. K's roll
notes the transfer of this man to Co. A. His name is not on the
original roll of Co. A, and is therefore omitted here. The following
note received from Captain Charles C. Norris, Co. A, explains:
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap2">Philadelphia</span>, July 12, 1904.</span><br />
Colonel <span class="smcap2">F. L. Hitchcock</span>, Scranton, Pa.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap2">My Dear Colonel</span>: ... I have a copy of the muster-out roll of
Co. A, to which I have referred.... I would also state that Charles
A. Meylert does not appear on the muster-out roll, nor was he at
any time carried on the roll of Co. A.... On the march from
Harper's Ferry to Warrenton, Va., about Nov. 1, 1862, Co. A held
an election for officers to fill vacancies caused by the promotion of
Captain Shreve to be major of the regiment. The following were
elected: Chas. C. Norris, captain; Thomas Maxwell, first lieutenant,
and Edward W. Roderick, second lieutenant. The result of
this election was forwarded through head-quarters to Governor
Curtin. The commissions were not sent on until some time in
December, 1862. Colonel Albright, commanding the regiment, sent
for me one day and told me he had received a commission for
Charles A. Meylert as second lieutenant of Co. A; that it was an
outrage upon Co. A, and that he would send it back to Governor
Curtin with a letter, which I believe he did, the result of which was
Roderick's commission was issued in accordance with his election,
and he was mustered in, and Meylert's commission was revoked.
As the commanding officer of Co. A, I never received any official
notice or record of Meylert's commission or muster into service;
hence his name was never entered upon my company roll. How
Bates came to place his name upon my roll, I do not know.
